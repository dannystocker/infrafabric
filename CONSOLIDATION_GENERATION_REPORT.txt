================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
================================================================================

ZERO-RISK ACTIONS (59 files, 7.93 MB)
  - Exact duplicate deletion
  - Identical SHA256 hashes
  - No dependencies identified
  - Can execute immediately after backup
  - Recommendations: Execute in phases (test small files first)

LOW-RISK ACTIONS (53 file families, ~20 MB)
  - Version consolidation and archival
  - Clear version numbering (v1, v2, v3)
  - Latest versions dated Nov 13-15
  - Preserve old versions (don't delete)
  - Recommendation: Archive strategy, no content loss

SAFETY MEASURES BUILT-IN:
  ✓ Phase 1 backup requirement before Phase 4
  ✓ Non-destructive Phases 2-3 (archive, don't delete)
  ✓ Phase 5 verification with checksums
  ✓ Broken symlink detection
  ✓ File count and size validation

================================================================================
SPACE RECOVERY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Immediate Recovery (Phase 4 Deletions):
  - 59 exact duplicates
  - 7.93 MB freed
  - Risk: ZERO
  - Execution time: 5 minutes
  - Irreversible: YES (backup required)

Medium-term Recovery (Version Archival):
  - 53 version families → 1 per family kept
  - ~20 MB freed via organization
  - Risk: MINIMAL
  - Execution time: 10 minutes
  - Reversible: YES (archived, not deleted)

Total Recovery Potential: ~28 MB (7.26% of total volume)
Current Utilization: 385.87 MB → 357.94 MB (estimated)

Space Distribution:
  Exact Duplicates:           7.93 MB (2.06% overhead)
  Version Variants:          20.00 MB (5.19% overhead)
  Core Content:             357.94 MB (92.75% useful)

RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Today):
1. Review CONSOLIDATION_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (10 minutes)
2. Review CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md Section E (5 minutes)
3. Verify backup location (/home/setup/ writable)
4. Approve specific action items

SHORT-TERM (This Week):
1. Execute Phase 1 backup (cp command, 2 minutes)
2. Execute Phases 2-3 (structure + archival, 11 minutes)
3. Execute Phase 4 deletion (test with smallest files first)
4. Execute Phase 5 verification (5 minutes)

MEDIUM-TERM (After Consolidation):
1. Update agents.md with new file paths
2. Update SESSION-RESUME.md with completion note
3. Document any exceptional findings
4. Archive this report for historical reference

LONG-TERM (Ongoing Maintenance):
1. Implement version naming convention
2. Establish archive workflow (auto-move old → archives/)
3. Schedule monthly audit of downloads folder
4. Consider symlink strategy for cross-project references
