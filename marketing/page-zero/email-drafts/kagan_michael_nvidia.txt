Subject: Building AI Factories That Scale Beyond Classical Networking Limits

Dear Michael,

Your Sequoia Europe100 keynote on scaling to million-GPU data centers articulates NVIDIA's most ambitious networking challenge. Managing inference-to-training workload shifts while architecting petascale clusters requires network fabric evolution—building AI factories that anticipate quantum networking without rearchitecting everything twice.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Quantum-safe AI infrastructure that future-proofs million-GPU clusters for quantum networking integration
• Network architectures beyond Moore's Law supporting petascale AI with quantum-ready fabric
• Data center efficiency management through quantum-enhanced coordination at scale

Our strategic research report explores quantum-ready networking architectures for petascale AI clusters. Given your focus on million-GPU systems and network scalability beyond classical limits, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for quantum-extensible AI factory design.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could ensure NVIDIA's AI factories scale beyond classical networking constraints?

Best regards,
