Subject: Eliminating LPU Latency Bottlenecks Through Quantum Coordination Channels

Dear Jonathan,

Your $1.5B Saudi agreement and deployment of 1.7M LPUs targeting 50% of global inference by 2027 represents the industry's most aggressive inference scaling vision. LPU on-chip memory eliminates one bottleneck—but coordinating 1.7M+ processors at ultra-low latency without external memory dependencies requires revolutionary interconnect architecture.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Distributed quantum network management coordinating LPU clusters via quantum entanglement channels
• Inference latency elimination by bypassing classical memory hierarchy limits through quantum coordination
• Ultra-low latency orchestration across 1.7M+ LPUs faster than classical interconnect physics allows

Our strategic research report explores quantum coordination for distributed inference systems. Given your target of 50% global inference share and focus on revolutionary low-latency architecture, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for quantum-enhanced LPU cluster coordination.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how quantum coordination channels could support Groq's inference dominance vision?
