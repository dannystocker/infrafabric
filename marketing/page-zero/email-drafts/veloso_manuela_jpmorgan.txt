Subject: Coordinating JPMorgan's 2000+ AI Experts with Quantum-Enhanced Financial Modeling

Dear Manuela,

Your leadership of JPMorgan's 80-person AI research team and 2000+ AI/ML experts represents the financial industry's largest quantum-AI convergence opportunity. The JPMC-MIT CSAIL partnership and R&D100 Award for MAQ quantum ML demonstrate readiness for hybrid quantum-classical workflows in portfolio optimization and fraud detection.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination enabling JPMorgan's AI teams to leverage quantum-enhanced financial modeling
• Portfolio optimization and fraud detection systems that outperform classical-only approaches through quantum acceleration
• Enterprise-scale orchestration coordinating 2000+ AI/ML experts with quantum computing resources

Our strategic research report explores quantum-enhanced financial modeling architectures. Given your team's MAQ quantum ML work and scale of AI deployment, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for hybrid quantum-classical financial applications.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could augment JPMorgan's AI capabilities with quantum computing?

Best regards,
