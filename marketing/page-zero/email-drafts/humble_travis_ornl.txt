Subject: Extending Oak Ridge's Quantum-HPC Integration to Native Accelerator Orchestration

Dear Travis,

Your pioneering work integrating IQM Radiance, Quantum Brilliance, and Riverlane QEC with Oak Ridge systems establishes the national lab's leadership in hybrid quantum-classical supercomputing. The R&D100 Award for MAQ quantum ML proves the integration works—now scaling requires orchestration that treats quantum as first-class HPC resources.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination treating quantum computers as native HPC accelerators
• Unified orchestration of Frontier exascale systems with multiple quantum computing platforms
• Leadership-class hybrid supercomputer coordination for national security and science missions

Our strategic research report explores quantum-HPC orchestration architectures for national laboratories. Given your pioneering quantum-HPC-AI integration work and deployment of multiple quantum systems, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for treating quantum as native HPC resources.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could scale Oak Ridge's quantum-HPC integration vision?

Best regards,
