Subject: Orchestrating Your Million-Qubit Photonic Architecture Across Brisbane and Chicago

Dear Jeremy,

Your February 2025 Omega chipset breakthrough—delivering all components for million-qubit systems in manufacturing-ready silicon photonics—represents the industry's most ambitious distributed quantum architecture. Coordinating photonic quantum computers across Brisbane and Chicago facilities at unprecedented scale requires orchestration infrastructure native to your distributed design.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Distributed quantum network management leveraging your silicon photonics infrastructure natively
• Coordination of million-qubit photonic systems across geographically distributed quantum compute centers
• Quantum networking capabilities that treat photonic architectures as first-class networked systems

Our strategic research report explores distributed photonic quantum architectures and their networking requirements. Given PsiQuantum's inherently networked photonic approach spanning multiple facilities, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for orchestrating distributed quantum systems at million-qubit scale.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how quantum network orchestration could support PsiQuantum's multi-site distributed architecture?

Best regards,
