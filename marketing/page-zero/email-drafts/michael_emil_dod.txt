Subject: Orchestrating Your Quantum-AI North Stars Across DoD's 14 CTAs

Dear Emil,

Your identification of quantum and AI as "North Star" Critical Technology Areas represents the Pentagon's most ambitious technology coordination challenge. Flattening DoD's tech structure to synchronize these priorities across 14 CTAs while accelerating DIU's commercial transition pipeline requires unprecedented orchestration capability.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Multi-stakeholder quantum-AI governance frameworks that unify DoD's North Star priorities across defense technology development
• Commercial tech transition acceleration through DIU with security requirements met by design
• Enterprise-wide quantum-classical hybrid coordination that scales across all 14 Critical Technology Areas

Our strategic research report explores quantum-AI orchestration architectures for defense innovation ecosystems. Given your mandate to synchronize quantum and AI as enterprise-wide priorities, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for accelerating commercial technology transition while maintaining national security requirements.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could support DoD's North Star technology integration?

Best regards,
