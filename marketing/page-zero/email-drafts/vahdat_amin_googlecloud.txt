Subject: Solving Your Networking Bottleneck for the Year of Inference

Dear Amin,

Your March 2025 Optica presentation identifying networking as the #1 bottleneck—with AI demand growing 10x annually while interconnects lag—captures the fundamental constraint limiting distributed inference at hyperscale. Ironwood's 42.5 exaflops proves compute leadership, but interconnect physics remains the governor on your "Year of Inference" vision.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Quantum-enhanced communication channels for agentic AI inference workloads distributed across TPU fabrics
• Orchestration of distributed inference that bypasses classical networking bottlenecks through quantum coordination
• Scaling inference workload distribution at the 10x annual rate your demand requires

Our strategic research report explores quantum networking solutions for AI infrastructure bottlenecks. Given your focus on inference distribution and networking constraints, I believe you'd find particular value in our analysis of quantum-enhanced interconnect architectures for hyperscale TPU deployments.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how quantum coordination channels could support Google Cloud's inference scaling ambitions?
