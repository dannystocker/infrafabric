Subject: Unifying Azure's Classical AI and Quantum Services in Enterprise Control Plane

Dear Mark,

Your Microsoft Ignite discussions on confidential computing and quantum computing in cloud articulate Azure's dual challenge: securing AI infrastructure against quantum threats while enabling hybrid quantum-classical services. Enterprise customers need a single control plane that orchestrates both computational paradigms with post-quantum cryptography throughout.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Post-quantum cryptography integration protecting Azure's AI services from quantum threats
• Unified control plane orchestrating hybrid quantum-classical workloads for enterprise customers
• Enterprise-grade security spanning classical AI and Azure Quantum services in single management layer

Our strategic research report explores PQC-secured hybrid cloud architectures. Given your focus on securing AI infrastructure while enabling quantum-classical services at enterprise scale, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for unified quantum-safe orchestration.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could unify Azure's AI and quantum offerings with enterprise-grade security?

Best regards,
