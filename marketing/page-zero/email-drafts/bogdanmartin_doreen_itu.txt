Subject: Coordinating ITU's AI and Quantum Standards Across 193 Nations

Dear Doreen,

As ITU's first woman Secretary-General leading the 2025 International Year of Quantum Science & Technology, you're coordinating AI and quantum standards across 193 member nations simultaneously. The AI for Good Summit and International AI Standards Summit represent unprecedented multi-stakeholder coordination challenges requiring unified governance frameworks.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Multi-stakeholder quantum-AI governance frameworks ensuring interoperability across 193 ITU member nations
• Unified standards development coordinating AI and quantum telecommunications convergence
• International coordination infrastructure for technology standards spanning both domains

Our strategic research report explores multi-stakeholder governance for quantum-AI convergence. Given your mandate to coordinate AI and quantum standards internationally during the International Year of Quantum, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for unified cross-domain standards development.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could support ITU's quantum-AI standards harmonization across member nations?

Best regards,
