Dear Daniel,

Your 2025 appointment as Global Head of AI Engineering & Science positions you to define Goldman's AI strategy across trading and risk platforms. With quantum computing poised to transform optimization and security, the strategic opportunity lies in coordinating AI engineering with quantum-enhanced capabilities that outperform classical-only approaches.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical optimization for algorithmic trading outperforming classical limits
• AI engineering coordination with quantum-enhanced risk modeling across Goldman's platforms
• Enterprise-scale orchestration enabling your teams to leverage quantum capabilities seamlessly

Our strategic research report explores quantum-enhanced optimization for financial services. Given your mandate to scale AI engineering and Goldman's need for competitive algorithmic trading edge, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for hybrid quantum-classical financial optimization.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could give Goldman's AI engineering a quantum-powered competitive advantage?

Best regards,
