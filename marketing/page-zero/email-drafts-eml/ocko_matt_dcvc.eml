Dear Matt,

Your DCVC investments spanning quantum sensing, quantum computing, and AI infrastructure position the firm uniquely at the convergence of technologies critical for national resilience. Portfolio companies developing capabilities across both domains need integration frameworks that accelerate commercialization and deployment coordination.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Multi-stakeholder quantum-AI governance coordinating portfolio companies across both technology domains
• Unified integration frameworks accelerating deep tech commercialization for defense and enterprise
• National resilience deployment coordination enabling quantum and AI portfolio synergies

Our strategic research report explores portfolio-level quantum-AI integration strategies. Given your focus on national resilience and investments spanning quantum systems and AI infrastructure, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for coordinating deep tech portfolios.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could accelerate integration across DCVC's quantum and AI investments?

Best regards,
