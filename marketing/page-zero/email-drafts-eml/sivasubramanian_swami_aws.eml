Dear Swami,

Your appointment as VP of Agentic AI and AgentCore's 1M+ SDK downloads demonstrate AWS's leadership in multi-agent systems. Achieving 40% better completion rates through multi-agent collaboration reveals the power of orchestration—but scaling production-ready agentic AI across distributed enterprise infrastructure demands quantum-grade coordination security.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Multi-agent AI orchestration with quantum-secured communication channels at AWS global scale
• Hybrid quantum-classical task routing for enterprise-grade reliability across distributed agentic systems
• Production-ready coordination that scales multi-agent collaboration beyond current architectural limits

Our strategic research report explores quantum-enhanced orchestration architectures for agentic AI systems. Given your focus on reliable multi-agent collaboration across distributed infrastructure, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for quantum-secured agent coordination at cloud scale.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how quantum coordination infrastructure could support AWS's agentic AI platform evolution?

Best regards,
