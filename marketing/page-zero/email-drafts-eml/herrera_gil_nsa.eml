Dear Gil,

Your 2025 Defense R&D Summit warning about "black swan" quantum breakthroughs that could "wreck world economy" by breaking encryption articulates NSA's most critical challenge. Preventing catastrophic failure of financial systems, nuclear command-and-control, and government networks requires orchestrating national PQC transition while continuously monitoring quantum advances.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Post-quantum cryptography integration orchestrating national encryption transition at scale
• Quantum computing monitoring systems ensuring defenses stay ahead of adversary capabilities
• Proactive security architecture preventing black swan quantum breakthrough scenarios

Our strategic research report explores coordinated PQC transition frameworks for national security. Given your focus on preventing catastrophic quantum threats to critical infrastructure, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for orchestrated quantum-safe defense.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could support NSA's proactive quantum security architecture?

Best regards,
