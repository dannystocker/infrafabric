Dear Mustafa,

Your Microsoft AI leadership and Copilot personalization advances demonstrate deep understanding of AI differentiation. With 24+ DeepMind researchers now at Microsoft and Azure Quantum services maturing, the strategic opportunity lies in coordinating Copilot with quantum-enhanced reasoning capabilities competitors cannot match.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination enabling Microsoft Copilot to leverage Azure Quantum services seamlessly
• Quantum-enhanced reasoning for AI personality differentiation beyond purely classical assistants
• Production-ready integration of quantum computing with consumer AI products at Microsoft scale

Our strategic research report explores quantum-enhanced AI reasoning architectures for consumer applications. Given your focus on differentiating Copilot through personalization and Azure Quantum integration priorities, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for quantum-augmented AI assistants.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could enable quantum-enhanced Copilot capabilities?

Best regards,
