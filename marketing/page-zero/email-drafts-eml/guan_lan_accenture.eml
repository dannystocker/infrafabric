Dear Lan,

Your leadership of Accenture's $3B AI initiative across 800K employees and 9,000+ clients represents the consulting industry's largest quantum-AI readiness opportunity. Deploying AI solutions at this scale demands architecture that enables future quantum-AI upgrades without forcing client rearchitecture—differentiating Accenture from competitors through forward compatibility.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Multi-stakeholder quantum-AI governance coordinating 9,000+ client deployments with quantum-ready architecture
• Seamless future quantum augmentation without client system rearchitecture or migration
• Enterprise-scale coordination enabling Accenture to offer quantum-AI consulting services competitors cannot match

Our strategic research report explores quantum-ready AI architectures for consulting deployments. Given your 9,000-client scale and need for competitive differentiation, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for future-proof quantum-compatible AI systems.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could position Accenture's AI deployments for seamless quantum enhancement?

Best regards,
