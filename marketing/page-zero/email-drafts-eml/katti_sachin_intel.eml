Dear Sachin,

Your appointment as Intel CTO & AI Chief under CEO Lip-Bu Tan carries the mandate to define coherent AI strategy after Gaudi struggles and Falcon Shores cancellation. Intel's differentiation opportunity lies where NVIDIA is weakest: hybrid quantum-classical systems leveraging Intel's photonics and networking IP competitors lack.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination positioning Intel as the pioneer in quantum-ready AI accelerators
• Photonics and networking advantages leveraged for quantum-classical hybrid workloads NVIDIA cannot match
• Coherent AI portfolio strategy differentiated through quantum integration capabilities

Our strategic research report explores quantum-classical hybrid AI architectures. Given your mandate to differentiate Intel's AI strategy and Intel's unique photonics/networking strengths, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for quantum-enabled AI differentiation.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could position Intel's AI portfolio for quantum-classical leadership?

Best regards,
