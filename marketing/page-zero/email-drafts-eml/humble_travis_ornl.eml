Dear Travis,

Your pioneering work integrating IQM Radiance, Quantum Brilliance, and Riverlane QEC with Oak Ridge systems establishes the national lab's leadership in hybrid quantum-classical supercomputing. The R&D100 Award for MAQ quantum ML proves the integration works—now scaling requires orchestration that treats quantum as first-class HPC resources.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination treating quantum computers as native HPC accelerators
• Unified orchestration of Frontier exascale systems with multiple quantum computing platforms
• Leadership-class hybrid supercomputer coordination for national security and science missions

Our strategic research report explores quantum-HPC orchestration architectures for national laboratories. Given your pioneering quantum-HPC-AI integration work and deployment of multiple quantum systems, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for treating quantum as native HPC resources.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could scale Oak Ridge's quantum-HPC integration vision?

Best regards,
