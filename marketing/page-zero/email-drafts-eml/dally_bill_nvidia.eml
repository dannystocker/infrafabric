Dear Bill,

Your Hot Chips 2024 presentation on 100 TOPS/watt energy efficiency and research on optical interconnects articulates NVIDIA's next-generation architecture challenges. Your work on sparsity and high-speed GPU communication opens quantum networking channels—coordinating photonic and electronic fabrics for the hybrid systems you're designing.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination bridging optical interconnects with quantum communication channels
• Shared interconnect architectures maximizing performance per watt across classical and quantum compute
• Photonic and electronic fabric coordination for next-generation energy-efficient AI systems

Our strategic research report explores quantum-photonic integration for AI interconnects. Given your research on optical interconnects and focus on energy-efficient communication at scale, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for quantum-classical networking convergence.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could extend NVIDIA's optical interconnect vision to quantum channels?

Best regards,
