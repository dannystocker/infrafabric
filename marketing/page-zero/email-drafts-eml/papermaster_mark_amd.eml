Dear Mark,

Your OCP 2025 launch of open rack-scale AI platforms with MI355X GPUs represents the industry's strongest counter to NVIDIA's closed ecosystem. Achieving 38X energy efficiency through open standards proves the commercial viability of your vision—but the architecture's true strategic value lies in quantum extensibility.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination layers that extend OCP rack-scale standards to quantum accelerators
• Open AI infrastructure designed today that gracefully incorporates quantum compute tomorrow
• Standards-based orchestration enabling hyperscaler adoption of quantum-ready rack-scale systems

Our strategic research report explores open standards architectures for quantum-classical hybrid systems. Given your focus on open rack-scale platforms competing against closed ecosystems, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for quantum extensibility through standards-based orchestration.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could extend AMD's open platform vision to quantum-ready systems?

Best regards,
