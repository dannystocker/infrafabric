Dear Shaun,

Your quantum physics PhD from Caltech and early IonQ Series A investment at GV demonstrate deep technical understanding of quantum computing's trajectory. Now managing Sequoia's positions in both IonQ and xAI positions you uniquely to see quantum-AI convergence opportunities your portfolio companies cannot capture independently.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination connecting your quantum computing investments with AI companies
• Quantum-enhanced training and inference capabilities spanning IonQ hardware and xAI workloads
• Portfolio-level orchestration enabling your investments to capture convergence value together

Our strategic research report explores hybrid quantum-AI architectures for venture portfolios. Given your quantum physics expertise and investments spanning both domains, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for portfolio-level quantum-AI integration.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could unlock convergence opportunities across your quantum and AI investments?

Best regards,
