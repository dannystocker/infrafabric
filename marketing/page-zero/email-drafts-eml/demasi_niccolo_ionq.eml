Dear Niccolo,

Your aggressive acquisition strategy—Qubitekk, IDQ, Lightsynq, Capella Space, and proposed Oxford Ionics—created the industry's most comprehensive quantum portfolio spanning computing, networking, sensing, and space-based QKD. Six acquisitions need orchestration infrastructure that makes these assets work together as the unified quantum powerhouse you envision.

InfraFabric is coordination infrastructure designed for the quantum-AI convergence era. We're building the orchestration layer that enables:
• Hybrid quantum-classical coordination unifying your multi-vendor quantum ecosystem in enterprise-deployable control plane
• Distributed quantum network management connecting computing, networking, sensing, and space QKD systems
• AI workflow integration enabling enterprise customers to leverage your complete quantum portfolio seamlessly

Our strategic research report explores multi-vendor quantum ecosystem orchestration. Given your vision of creating the most advanced quantum computing and networking roadmap through strategic acquisitions, I believe you'd find particular value in our framework for portfolio-wide coordination.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about how coordination infrastructure could unify IonQ's quantum ecosystem acquisitions?

Best regards,
