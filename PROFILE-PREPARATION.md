## Missing Data Resolution Strategy

### Information Discovery During Engagement

**First email (Week of Dec 9):**
- Share what we know
- Show RAPPORT document
- Ask for 15-minute call
- Initial response tells us his interest level

**Demo call (Week of Dec 10-15):**
- Show InfraFabric in action
- Answer his questions
- Observe his engagement style
- Understand his communication preferences

**Partnership discussion (Week of Dec 17+):**
- Ask about client list
- Discuss revenue potential
- Explore business model fit
- Understand growth ambitions
- Clarify AI tools/workflows

**Pilot execution (Jan 1-20):**
- Work with 1-2 of his actual clients
- See how he operates
- Understand real constraints
- Validate assumptions
- Build relationship foundation

**Scale planning (Feb+):**
- Once pilot succeeds
- Discuss growth trajectory
- Plan account expansion
- Define long-term partnership
- Establish success metrics

### Why This Progressive Approach Works

1. **Efficient:** Only asks what's needed, when it's needed
2. **Respectful:** Doesn't demand sensitive info upfront
3. **Builds trust:** Information sharing is mutual process
4. **Reduces risk:** Validates fit before major commitment
5. **Natural:** Mirrors normal business development flow
