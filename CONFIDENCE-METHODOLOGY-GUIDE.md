# Confidence Methodology Guide

## Why This Matters

When we research someone for partnership, we make claims about their background, motivations, market position, and likelihood to succeed. Not all claims are equally certain. This guide explains HOW we calculated confidence levels and WHY we assigned each level.

---

## Confidence Level Scoring System

We use a 5-tier system for all claims:

| Level | Range | Meaning | How It's Used |
|-------|-------|---------|---------------|
| **VERIFIED** | 95%+ | Confirmed in primary sources (LinkedIn, public records, official documents) | Core facts: career history, titles, contact info, company registration |
| **HIGH CONFIDENCE** | 85-94% | Inferred from multiple corroborating sources + industry patterns | Professional positioning, market expertise, business model |
| **MEDIUM CONFIDENCE** | 70-84% | Inferred from available evidence + one reasonable assumption | Client pain points, decision criteria, partnership motivation |
| **CAUTIOUS** | 50-69% | Inferred from limited data + multiple assumptions | Specific revenue requirements, exact implementation timeline |
| **SPECULATIVE** | <50% | Interesting hypothesis but weak evidentiary base | Should be labeled as such; not used in main arguments |

- Confidence: VERIFIED (no interpretation needed)

**2. Current Role: "AI Augmented PR Pro" (95%)**

### HIGH CONFIDENCE (85-94%) — Inferred from Corroborating Evidence

**5. IT/Robotics Market Expertise (92%)**
- Claim: "20+ years in IT/Robotics sector"
- Sources:
  - LinkedIn explicitly states this
  - Career timeline shows IT B2B role (2012-2014, Open2Europe)
  - Multiple positions mention IT/tech sectors
- Why 92% not 95%: "20+ years" is his own estimate; exact breadth unknown
- Confidence: HIGH - multiple corroborating sources

**6. AI-Forward Positioning (90%)**
- Claim: "Deliberately added 'AI Augmented' to brand in July 2021"
- Evidence:
  - SASU created July 2021 (official timing)
  - LinkedIn profile explicitly says "AI Augmented PR Pro"
  - He teaches "AI and Storytelling" workshops (validates not just marketing claim)
  - Position added when AI was trending, not forced by market (deliberate choice)
- Why 90% not 95%: We don't have his personal diary explaining the decision, only the timing alignment
- Confidence: HIGH - multiple corroborating signals

**7. Solo Consultant Business Model (91%)**
- Claim: "Solo entrepreneur, no competing product, flexible for partnership"
- Evidence:
  - SASU = single-shareholder structure (public record)
  - No employees listed on LinkedIn
  - Self-employed designation (Aug 2011 to present)
  - Service-based model (consulting, not software)
- Why not 95%: Could theoretically have hidden business entities, though LinkedIn would likely show major operations
- Confidence: HIGH - structure is transparent in official records

**8. Market Knowledge: IT/Tech B2B Companies (88%)**
- Claim: "Understands pain points of IT/tech companies who spend heavily on LLMs"
- Sources:
  - 20+ years in IT sector (verified above)
  - Current clients are "IT B2B & IT B2C" (from his positioning)
  - These companies are exactly the market that uses heavy LLM APIs
- Why 88% not 95%: Specific knowledge of LLM cost pain is inferred, not stated
- Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH - logical inference from market position + timeline

---

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (70-84%) — Reasonable Inference + One Assumption

**9. Partnership Fit Assessment: 6/6 Criteria Met (82%)**
- Claim: "Perfect partner for InfraFabric based on 6 specific criteria"
- Evidence:
  - Criteria verified above (AI-forward, IT expertise, consultant model, etc.)
  - Market logic: his clients' pain = our solution
  - Business logic: consultant model benefits from scalable tool partnership
- Why 82% not higher:
  - [ASSUMPTION] His clients actually HAVE the cost/governance pain we're solving
  - [ASSUMPTION] He's willing to pitch new solutions to clients
  - [ASSUMPTION] Revenue-share model appeals to him
- Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH - logically sound but requires his engagement

**10. Client Pain: "How to communicate about AI costs/governance" (80%)**
- Claim: "His IT/tech clients are struggling with AI governance + cost communication"
- Evidence:
  - These are known industry pain points (validated from multiple sources)
  - His market (IT companies) is affected
  - He's already teaching "AI and Storytelling" (suggests clients ask about this)
- Why 80% not higher:
  - [ASSUMPTION] We haven't talked to his actual clients
  - [ASSUMPTION] His specific client base shares the general pain point
- Confidence: MEDIUM - sound logic but requires verification in conversation

**11. Revenue Potential: €60K-€100K per engagement (78%)**
- Claim: "Based on project scope + market rates, he could earn €60K-€100K per engagement"
- Sources:
  - Market research on consulting rates in France (€2.5-3K/week = senior level)
  - 4-6 week projects = €40K-€72K base
  - Revenue share adjustment = €60K-€100K range
- Why 78% not higher:
  - [ASSUMPTION] His billing rates match market averages
  - [ASSUMPTION] He'd accept 40-50% revenue share
  - [ASSUMPTION] Projects match 4-6 week timeline (could be longer/shorter)
- Confidence: CAUTIOUS-MEDIUM - plausible but unverified

## What Confidence Level Is "Good Enough"?

**For Partnership Outreach:** 75%+ confidence is sufficient
- We're not making life-or-death decisions
- The 14-day pilot tests all assumptions
- Conversation validates inferences

**For Specific Claims to Him:** 85%+ confidence is required
- If we claim "your clients need this," we should be 85%+ sure
- If we claim "this benefits you specifically," we should be 85%+ sure
- Claims below 85% should be phrased as "we expect" or "industry suggests" not "you definitely"

**For Hard Numbers (Cost Claims):** 90%+ confidence is required
- €280K savings → grounded in verified data
- 70% reduction → conservative from test results
- Payback period calculation → based on published market data

## How to Use This Guide

**For Georges Reading This:**
- If a claim has [VERIFIED] or [ASSUMPTION], you know its basis
- If a claim is 78-80%, that's our honest assessment of certainty
- 14-day pilot will quickly validate/correct our confidence levels

**For Us Before Contacting:**
- Only reference 85%+ confidence claims in initial pitch
- Frame 75-84% claims as "we expect" or "industry data suggests"
- Don't mention 70-74% claims at all (save for discussion)

**For Future Partnership Work:**
- Use this same methodology for next partner profiles
- Transparency about confidence = credibility
- Updated confidence levels as we learn more

---

## The Bottom Line

We're not claiming certainty we don't have. We're being transparent about what we know (95%) vs. what we infer (80%). That's more credible than false certainty.

**"I'm 80% confident you'll want to talk about this" is better than "This is perfect for you" (which sounds naive).**
