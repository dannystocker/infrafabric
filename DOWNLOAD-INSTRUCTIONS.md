- He'll share in partnership discussion
- Never try to research via LinkedIn connections

### "I need his revenue/business size"
- Private company data
- Ask in partnership discussion: "What's your typical engagement size?"
- He'll share financial details when ready
- Not necessary to know before first contact

### "I need his photo for materials"
- Request permission: "Can I include your LinkedIn photo in our presentation?"
- Screenshot his profile (backup)
- Use generic professional photos if denied
- Always respect copyright and privacy

### "Demo doesn't work"
- Open in modern browser: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
- Check file isn't corrupted (file size: ~30KB)
- Try opening from different location
- If issues: contact technical support team

### "Email bounces"
