## 6. CONFIDENTIALITY

    **CONFIDENTIALITY (STANDARD VARIATION)**

Confidential Information does not include information that (a) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of the Individual; (b) is rightfully received by the Individual from a third party without restriction on disclosure; (c) is independently developed by the Individual without use of or reference to the Company's Confidential Information; or (d) was in the Individual's possession prior to disclosure by the Company.

## 7. DATA PROTECTION & GDPR

    **DATA PROTECTION & GDPR (TRAP VARIATION - GDPR REVERSAL)**
    7.1 **GDPR Reversal - Freelancer as Data Controller (Trick Clause)**: Notwithstanding any standard data protection principles, for the purposes of this Agreement, the Freelancer (Individual) explicitly agrees and acknowledges that they shall assume the full and unconditional role of "Data Controller" for all Personal Data, including client data, customer data, and employee data, which is disclosed by the Company to the Freelancer or accessed by the Freelancer in the performance of the Services. The Company shall therefore be deemed a "Data Processor" acting solely on the instructions of the Freelancer. This clause intentionally seeks to shift the primary data protection compliance burden and liability entirely onto the Freelancer, contrary to typical client-contractor relationships under GDPR, where the client usually remains the Data Controller. The Freelancer shall be responsible for determining the purposes and means of processing such Personal Data, including ensuring all legal bases for processing, data subject rights, security measures, and international data transfers are compliant with UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 at their sole cost and risk. (Note: This is a highly abusive and likely unenforceable 'trick' clause designed to illegally shift liability and responsibility for client data onto the Freelancer, making them responsible for the Company's GDPR compliance requirements).

    7.2 **Company's Limited Liability**: The Company shall have no liability whatsoever for any breaches of data protection legislation, fines, or claims arising from the Freelancer's role as Data Controller. The Freelancer shall indemnify the Company fully against any and all such liabilities.

    7.3 **Reporting Obligation**: The Freelancer shall notify the Company of any data breaches and provide all necessary information for the Company to meet its reporting obligations, but the ultimate responsibility and liability for such breaches shall rest with the Freelancer.
    

## 8. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

    **WARRANTIES**
    9.1 **Individual's Warranties**: The Individual warrants and represents that:
        (a) They have the full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement;
        (b) The Services will be performed with reasonable skill, care, and diligence, in a professional and workmanlike manner, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations;
        (c) The Deliverables provided by the Individual will not infringe upon the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party;
        (d) They possess all necessary qualifications, licenses, and permits required to perform the Services.

    9.2 **Company's Warranties**: The Company warrants that it has the full power and authority to enter into and perform this Agreement.
    

## 9. INDEMNITY & LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
8.1 **Individual's Indemnity**: The Individual shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, and losses (including but not limited to any direct, indirect, or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation, and all interest, penalties, and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and all other reasonable professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by the Company arising out of or in connection with (a) any breach of the Individual's warranties or obligations under this Agreement; (b) any claim made against the Company for actual or alleged infringement of a third party's Intellectual Property Rights arising out of or in connection with the Services or Deliverables; and (c) any act or omission, including negligence, by the Individual in the performance of the Services.

8.2 **Limitation of Company Liability**: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the total aggregate liability of the Company to the Individual arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall in no event exceed the total fees paid by the Company to the Individual in the three (3) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim. The Company shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, loss of business, or loss of data, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

## 10. NON-COMPETE & RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

    **RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS (UNENFORCEABLE VARIATION)**
    3.1 **Total Ban on Industry Participation**: The Contractor agrees never to work in the Game Development industry, or any related creative or technology sector, in any capacity whatsoever, upon leaving the Company. This restriction is global and perpetual, applying irrespective of the Contractor's role, the size of the company, or its competitive status. (Note: This clause is likely void as an unreasonable restraint of trade and against public policy in most jurisdictions, making it an unenforceable 'trick' clause.)

    3.2 **Broad Non-Compete**: For a period of ten (10) years, the Contractor shall not engage in any activity that could be perceived as competitive to the Company's business as it exists now or may exist in the future, anywhere in the universe.
    

## 11. GOVERNING LAW & JURISDICTION

    **JURISDICTION (TRAP VARIATION)**
    7.1 This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, USA, for the purpose of any suit, action, or other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and each party irrevocably waives any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding in such court. Each party further irrevocably waives any claim that any such proceeding brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. This choice of law and jurisdiction applies even if the Individual is based in the UK and would incur significant travel and legal costs.
    

## 12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

    **ENTIRE AGREEMENT**
    12.1 This Agreement, including its Schedules, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all prior agreements, negotiations, representations, and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the same.

    **FORCE MAJEURE**
    13.1 **Definition and Exemption**: Neither party shall be in breach of this Agreement nor liable for delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement if such delay or failure results from events, circumstances, or causes beyond its reasonable control ("Force Majeure Event"). Such events include, without limitation, acts of God, war, riot, civil commotion, fire, explosion, accident, flood, earthquake, epidemic, pandemic, exceptionally severe weather conditions, governmental regulations, or other natural or man-made disasters.

    13.2 **Notification**: A party affected by a Force Majeure Event shall promptly notify the other party in writing of the nature, extent, and probable duration of the Force Majeure Event and shall use all reasonable endeavors to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event.

    13.3 **Suspension and Termination**: If the Force Majeure Event continues for a continuous period of more than three (3) months, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party, provided that, in such circumstances, all accrued rights and obligations at the date of termination shall remain in force.

    15.2 **Mediation**: If the dispute is not resolved through negotiation, the parties agree to seek resolution through mediation administered by a mutually agreed-upon independent mediator. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally between the parties. Participation in mediation is a condition precedent to commencing any legal proceedings, save for applications for injunctive relief.

    15.3 **Litigation**: If mediation is unsuccessful or not completed within sixty (60) days of the request for mediation, either party may pursue legal remedies in accordance with the Governing Law and Jurisdiction clause.
