================================================================================
RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (24-48 hours):
1. Document current gaps in legal counsel briefing
2. Identify highest-priority missing sources for ContractGuard features
3. Draft official information request to LégisQuébec support
   Email: droit-auteur@justice.gouv.qc.ca
   Subject: Bulk download request for civil law corpus (ContractGuard research)

SHORT-TERM (1-2 weeks):
1. Implement Selenium-based WebDriver fallback for LégisQuébec portal
2. Increase timeout from 15s to 45s for large documents
3. Contact RBQ/CCQ directly for official statute PDF downloads
4. Request CanLII institutional/non-profit research access

MEDIUM-TERM (2-4 weeks):
1. Evaluate commercial legal database subscriptions:
   - QuickLaw (LexisNexis): Most comprehensive Quebec coverage
   - CanLII+ (if available): Remove rate-limiting on CanLII
   - WestlawNext (Thomson Reuters): Full Quebec law library
2. Obtain certification from Quebec legal counsel for document authenticity
3. Implement PDF-to-text conversion for large documents (Loi sur les impôts)

LONG-TERM (>4 weeks):
1. Establish official partnership with LégisQuébec for API access
2. Consider mirror/caching of Quebec statutes to avoid future blockages
3. Implement continuous legal document update mechanism

================================================================================
TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================================================================

PYTHON SCRIPT PERFORMANCE:
- Language: Python 3
- Libraries: urllib3, hashlib, logging
- Success: 36 downloads, 0 corruptions
- Performance: ~100 KB/s average download speed
- Rate limiting: 0.5s delay between requests (respected)

ERROR HANDLING:

3. Implement session pooling to reuse connections
4. Split large documents (>20 MB) into parallel chunks
5. Add progress bar for long downloads

DOCKER/CONTAINERIZATION:
- Consider containerized download process for reproducibility
- Mount /home/setup/if-legal-corpus as volume for persistence
- Add Chrome/Selenium container for JavaScript-based portals

STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION
================================================================================

FOR LEGAL TEAM:
"Successfully downloaded 36 Quebec legal documents (106 MB) covering 5 of 9
legal verticals. Bilingual coverage for employment, tax, and accounting law
fully available. Insurance, construction, and residential lease frameworks
pending government liaison (estimated 2-4 weeks for resolution)."

FOR ENGINEERING TEAM:
"36 markdown-formatted legal documents ready for LLM processing. Largest file
is 29.95 MB (tax code) - recommend chunking for LLM context windows. All files
have SHA-256 verification hashes available in manifest.json. See INDEX.md for
file organization and technical specifications."

FOR MANAGEMENT:
"Corpus delivery at 55% completion (36/65+ documents). Primary blockage is
CanLII platform rate-limiting (70% of failures). Mitigation strategies identified:
government liaison (2-4 weeks, no cost), WebDriver fallback (1 week, low cost),
or commercial database subscription ($500-2000). Current delivery enables MVP
for 5 contract types; full platform requires additional sourcing."
