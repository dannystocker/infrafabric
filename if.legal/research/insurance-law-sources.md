### For Clause Validation
- Compare contract language against statutory requirements in source jurisdiction
- Check minimum coverage amounts (especially EU EUR 1.3M requirement)
- Verify claims-made vs. occurrence language compliance
- Validate good faith/fair presentation language

### For Cross-Border Freelance Contracts
- If contract involves multiple jurisdictions: apply most protective standard
- Consider EU law harmonization (Solvency II, IDD) for multi-state EU contracts
