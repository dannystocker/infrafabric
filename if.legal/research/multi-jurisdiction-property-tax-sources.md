**Date:** 2025-11-28
**Purpose:** Identify comprehensive sources for property, tax, and accounting law across US, Canada, Australia, Germany, France, and EU
**Corpus Status:** Cross-reference against `/home/setup/if-legal-corpus/manifests/download_manifest.csv`

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive research on property law, tax law, and accounting law for six major jurisdictions. Coverage is organized by:

1. **Existing Coverage** - Already in legal corpus (verified against manifest)
2. **Critical Gaps** - P0 priority sources NOT yet in corpus
3. **Supplementary Sources** - P1/P2 priority additions
4. **Access Methods** - URLs, APIs, download strategies for each jurisdiction

**Key Finding:** Current corpus has strong IP/employment focus but lacks comprehensive property, tax, and accounting statutes. This research identifies 47 new P0/P1 sources to fill these gaps.

4. **International Tax**: No VAT Directive, no ATAD, no TP documentation directives
5. **Real Estate Specific**: No Torrens title, no mortgage regulation, no property registration law
6. **Business Entity Law**: Partial (Delaware contracts); missing GmbH Act (Germany), PPSA (Canada)

## Conclusion

This research identifies **47 new P0/P1 sources** to add comprehensive property law, tax law, and accounting law coverage to the legal corpus. Current gaps leave the system unable to analyze:

- Tax implications of contracts (26 USC missing/inaccessible)
- Secured lending arrangements (UCC Article 9 missing)
- Real property transfers (property law codes missing)
- Cross-border tax planning (VAT Directive, ATAD missing)
- Financial statement compliance (GAAP, IFRS, ASPE missing)

**Estimated Additional Corpus Size:** +240 MB (raw), +1.2GB (processed/indexed)

**Recommended Next Action:** Prioritize Phase 1 (P0) imports focusing on:
1. Verify access to existing entries (verify manifest errors)
2. Implement Cornell LII fallback for US federal law
3. Add 18 critical P0 sources from this research
4. Extend to P1 sources for state-level and international tax/property provisions
