## NOTES ON APPLICABILITY

### Contract Fraud vs. Contract Breach
- **Criminal fraud requires**: Intentional deception, false representation, reliance, damages
- **Contract breach alone is civil**: Not criminal unless it involves fraud, theft, or embezzlement
- **Relevant escalation point**: When breach is coupled with fraudulent inducement

### Jurisdictional Considerations
- **UK**: Common law + statutory fraud; includes "conspiracy to defraud"
- **US**: Federal crimes require interstate commerce; state crimes apply locally
- **Canada**: Unified federal Criminal Code; Quebec uses French version but same substantive law
- **Australia**: Mix of Commonwealth and state crimes; duplicative statutes
- **Germany**: StGB applies nationwide; Länder have procedural variations
- **France**: Code pénal applies nationwide; civil law system procedures differ
- **Spain**: CP applies nationwide; regional procedures vary (Catalunya, Basque Country)
- **EU**: Directives require member state implementation; harmonization improving

### Criminal Procedure Overlaps
- **Evidence standards**: Germany, France, Spain use inquisitorial systems (investigating judge)
- **US/UK/Canada/Australia**: Adversarial systems (prosecution vs. defense)
- **Statute of limitations**: Vary by jurisdiction (3-6-10 years typically)
- **Corporate liability**: All jurisdictions now recognize organizational criminal responsibility
