CONTRASTGUARD IMPLEMENTATION EXAMPLES
================================================================================

The research document includes 5 real-world application scenarios:

   Scenario 1: Product Misrepresentation in Contract
   → Criminal Statutes: UK Fraud Act 2006 §1, US 18 USC §1343, Canada §380, etc.
   → ContractGuard Action: Flag P0 fraud risk; suggest criminal referral

   Scenario 2: Forged Payment Authorization
   → Criminal Statutes: UK Forgery Act 1981, US 18 USC §1028, Canada §352, etc.
   → ContractGuard Action: Flag document crime; preserve evidence; notify institutions
