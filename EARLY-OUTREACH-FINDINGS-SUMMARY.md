## The Documentation Gap (Oct 30 - Nov 7)

**Critical Period:** Instance #1-5 execution
**Problem:** No console logs captured during this period
**Evidence:** 20+ output documents exist, but process logs missing
**Impact:** Cannot confirm whether outreach emails were actually sent

**Recovery Strategy:**
1. Danny interview (most direct)
2. Git log archaeology (who did what when)
3. Instance #4 retrospective narratives (may document what happened)
