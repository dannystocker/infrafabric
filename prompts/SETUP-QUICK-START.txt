GEMINI META-INTEGRATION PROMPT - QUICK START GUIDE
Setup Instructions & First Run
================================================================================

WELCOME! You now have a comprehensive Gemini orchestration system that will:
- Fetch Instance #12 deliverables from GitHub
- Read and synthesize 12+ key documents
- Generate a complete integration blueprint
- Output actionable recommendations in 6 sections

This quick start gets you running in 5 minutes.

================================================================================
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE (2 MIN READ)
================================================================================

Three files have been created in: /home/setup/infrafabric/prompts/

1. GEMINI-META-INTEGRATION-PROMPT.txt (44 KB)
   ↳ The main orchestration prompt (5,900 words)
   ↳ Tells Gemini to fetch, read, and synthesize
   ↳ Generates comprehensive 3,500+ word output

2. README-GEMINI-META-PROMPT.md (12 KB)
   ↳ Complete user guide with examples
   ↳ Explains what gets read, what you'll get
   ↳ Troubleshooting and best practices
   ↳ Read this if you want to understand the system

3. INDEX.md (8 KB)
   ↳ Directory index and quick reference
   ↳ Lists files and use cases
   ↳ Navigation guide for finding what you need

TOTAL: 68 KB, 8,750 words of prompts and documentation

================================================================================
STEP 2: COPY THE MAIN PROMPT (1 MIN)
================================================================================

File to copy: GEMINI-META-INTEGRATION-PROMPT.txt

Option A (Command Line):
  cd /home/setup/infrafabric/prompts
  cat GEMINI-META-INTEGRATION-PROMPT.txt | pbcopy

Option B (GUI):
  1. Open file: /home/setup/infrafabric/prompts/GEMINI-META-INTEGRATION-PROMPT.txt
  2. Select All (Ctrl+A)
  3. Copy (Ctrl+C)

Option C (If pbcopy doesn't work on your system):
  cat GEMINI-META-INTEGRATION-PROMPT.txt > /tmp/gemini-prompt.txt
  (Then open /tmp/gemini-prompt.txt and copy manually)

Verification:
  - You should have ~5,900 words copied
  - Starts with "================ GEMINI META-INTEGRATION PROMPT v1.0"
  - Ends with "END OF GEMINI-META-INTEGRATION-PROMPT.txt ================"

================================================================================
STEP 3: OPEN GEMINI (30 SECONDS)
================================================================================

Go to: https://gemini.google.com

If you're not logged in:
  1. Click "Sign in"
  2. Use your Google account
  3. Accept permissions

Once logged in:
  1. Click "+ New chat" or "Start a new conversation"
  2. You should see a message box ready for input

================================================================================
STEP 4: PASTE & SUBMIT (30 SECONDS)
================================================================================

In the Gemini chat:
  1. Click in the message input box
  2. Paste the prompt (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V)
  3. (Optional) Add context like: "Use this meta-prompt to synthesize Instance
     #12 deliverables and create a development roadmap for the enhanced app"
  4. Press "Send" or click the send button
  5. Gemini starts processing

DO NOT close the browser or chat during processing.

================================================================================
STEP 5: WAIT FOR GEMINI TO WORK (8-12 MINUTES)
================================================================================

What Gemini is doing:
  - Reading your prompt (1 min)
  - Fetching 12 documents from GitHub (2-3 min)
  - Analyzing documents in priority order (3-4 min)
  - Synthesizing across all documents (1-2 min)
  - Generating structured output (1-2 min)

What you'll see:
  - Typing animation while Gemini processes
  - Progress may seem slow—this is normal
  - Output will be 3,500-5,000 words (takes a minute to generate)

If Gemini stops or seems stuck:
  - Wait 30 more seconds (sometimes delays happen)
  - If truly stuck, you can stop and run again
  - Most runs complete successfully without issues

================================================================================
STEP 6: REVIEW THE OUTPUT (5-10 MINUTES)
================================================================================

Gemini will produce 6 sections:

SECTION A: Executive Summary
  - What Instance #12 accomplished
  - Intelligence findings overview
  - What's ready now
  - Read first (5 min) - good for high-level understanding

  - Current app structure
  - What to add (8 new components)
  - How they connect
  - Read second (10 min) - for technical planning

SECTION C: Feature Specifications
  - Detailed specs for each new feature
  - Implementation details
  - Interactive elements
  - Read third (10 min) - for dev team specifications

SECTION D: Content & Messaging
  - How to position the app
  - Key messages per section
  - French localization notes
  - Read fourth (5 min) - for messaging/positioning

SECTION E: Development Roadmap
  - Phase 1 (2 weeks): Critical path
  - Phase 2 (1-2 weeks): Important features

  ✓ TESTING_ROADMAP_BEFORE_GEORGES.md
  ✓ GEORGES-ANTOINE-GARY-RESEARCH-STRATEGY.md

Note: All files must be committed to GitHub for Gemini to read them. If a file
is missing, Gemini will note this and work with what's available.

================================================================================
EXPECTED OUTPUT

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Gemini says "I can't access GitHub"
SOLUTION: This is rare, but if it happens:
  - The prompt has fallback instructions
  - Gemini will work with general knowledge instead
  - Output will still be useful, just less detailed
  - Try again in a few minutes if it's a temporary issue

PROBLEM: Output is missing sections
SOLUTION:
  - Scroll down—output might be longer than expected
  - If truly missing, ask Gemini: "Can you provide Section X?"
  - Run prompt again (sometimes helps)

PROBLEM: Output seems incomplete
SOLUTION:
  - Read the entire output before concluding it's incomplete
  - Output is typically 5,000+ words, takes time to read
  - Ask Gemini to expand specific sections if needed

PROBLEM: Data seems outdated
SOLUTION:
  - Gemini fetches files in real-time from GitHub
  - If data is outdated, files in GitHub are probably outdated
  - Update source files and run prompt again

PROBLEM: French translations don't look right
SOLUTION:
  - Prompt notes that French should be reviewed by native speaker
  - Use Gemini output as draft, refine with human translator
  - This is expected—AI translation needs human review

PROBLEM: Copy/paste not working
SOLUTION:
  - On Linux: Install xclip, then: cat file.txt | xclip -selection clipboard
  - On Mac: cat file.txt | pbcopy
  - On Windows: Use Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V normally
  - Alternative: Open file in text editor, copy from there

================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

Before Running:
□ Ensure all deliverables are committed to GitHub
□ Check that yologuard/v3-publish branch exists (or use main)
□ Have 10 quiet minutes to monitor the process
□ Make sure you're logged into Gemini

During Run:
□ Don't close browser or chat window
□ Don't submit multiple prompts simultaneously
□ Let Gemini run to completion (8-12 minutes)
□ Monitor for any error messages

After Completion:
□ Read Section A first (executive summary)
□ Review all 6 sections before acting on output
□ Cross-check recommendations against your knowledge
□ Share appropriate sections with relevant teams
□ Use Section E/F for project planning

When Sharing Results:
□ Share Section A with executives/stakeholders
□ Share Section B-C with development team
□ Share Section E-F with project management
□ Share Section D with marketing/sales
□ Don't share all sections to everyone—overload

Using for Planning:
□ Treat effort estimates as initial estimates (may need refinement)
□ Use timeline as baseline (adjust for your team size)
□ Treat priority list as recommended, not absolute
□ Validate recommendations against your knowledge
□ Create contingency plans for high-risk items
