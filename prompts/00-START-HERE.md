3. Synthesizes across all documents
4. Outputs a comprehensive 3,500-5,000 word blueprint

**What you get:**
- Executive Summary (for stakeholders)
- Technical Architecture (for developers)
- Feature Specifications (detailed)
- Content & Messaging (positioning)
- Development Roadmap (3 phases, timelines)
- Next Steps & Checklist (launch readiness)

**How long:**
- Gemini runs: 8-12 minutes
- You read output: 30-45 minutes
- You use it: 1-2 hours for planning

**Why it's useful:**
- Saves 3-4 hours of manual document reading
- Synthesizes across 23 deliverables without manual compilation
- Provides specific, actionable recommendations (not vague)
- Generates development roadmap automatically
- Creates launch readiness checklist

## Troubleshooting

**"What if Gemini can't fetch a file?"**
→ Prompt has fallback instructions. Gemini will note what it couldn't reach and work with what's available.

**"What if output seems incomplete?"**
→ Scroll down first—output is usually 3,500-5,000 words. Ask Gemini to expand specific sections if needed.

**"What if I want to customize it?"**

**"What if French translations are wrong?"**
→ This is expected. Prompt notes that French should be reviewed by human translator. Use as draft.
