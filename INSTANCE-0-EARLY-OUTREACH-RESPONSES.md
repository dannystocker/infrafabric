## DAVE BLUNDIN: Complete Contact Strategy

### Template Found

**File Location:** `/mnt/c/Users/Setup/Downloads/IF-docs-files/dave-blundin-email-template.md`

**Email Subject:** "AI lemming infrastructure - quantum-native from day one"

**Template Body (Ready to Send):**

```
Dave,

I've been working on coordination infrastructure for AI systems and realized
it maps directly to the aligned AI infrastructure challenge your XPV fund addresses.

The problem: We're building multiple AI paradigms simultaneously (classical, quantum,
neuromorphic, nano-scale) with no shared substrate for coordination. Like building
aircraft without air traffic control.

The insight: Alignment through observable infrastructure rather than forced values.
Civil aviation model - diverse aircraft (Boeing, Airbus, props, jets) all using shared
protocols, graduated consequences, black box audit trails. Enables cooperation without
uniformity.

I've built complete technical architecture:
- Quantum-native from day one (post-quantum crypto)
- Pluralistic cluster governance (different AI communities, different rules, shared infrastructure)
- Observable coordination (IF-Trace audit layer)
- 36-month window before standards ossify

Given your neural network background, MIT teaching, and XPV's focus on aligned AI
for grand challenges, your perspective would be valuable.

Technical briefing available. 30 minutes if you're curious.

## EMAIL RESPONSE STATUS

### Confirmed Absences

**Dave Blundin Responses:** NOT FOUND
- Email template exists
- No confirmation of send date
- No response/meeting notes recovered
- Status: **Outreach intended but confirmation status unknown**

**Bertrand Folliet Responses:** NOT FOUND
- Contact referenced as high-priority warm intro

## CONTACT DISCOVERY EXECUTION TIMELINE

### Planned Sequence (from IF-docs-files):

**Week 1: Asset Finalization**
1. Complete 10-page briefing (integrate 4 layers + concrete examples)
2. Get professional design ($500 on Upwork)
3. Set up Stripe payment page
4. Create simple landing page

**Week 2: Launch + Contact**
5. Email Dave Blundin
6. Email Bertrand Folliet
7. Post Medium article
8. Post LinkedIn

### Success Metrics:

- **10 inquiries** = market interest exists
- **3 sales** = viable business model ($15K-75K revenue)
- **10 sales** = $50K-250K revenue, scale this
- **20 sales** = $500K+, validated market, recruit technical co-founder

---

## KEY INSIGHTS FROM OUTREACH STRATEGY

### Why The Lemming Metaphor Works:

**Computational Species in Isolation:**
- Classical Lemmings: GPT-4, Claude, Llama (silicon plains)
- Quantum Lemmings: IBM quantum, IonQ (floating crystalline structures)
- Neuromorphic Lemmings: Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth (edge computing)
- Nano-Scale Lemmings: DNA computing, molecular machines (biological substrates)

**The Biosphere Principle:**
IF provides the ecosystem (atmosphere, water cycle, nutrient flow) that lets these species coexist without forcing uniformity.

### Why This Matters:

**The 36-Month Window:**
1. Quantum computing arrives (2027-2030) - breaks classical crypto
2. AI coordination becomes mandatory (2025-2027) - regulatory + technical
3. Standards wars begin (2025-2026) - winner-takes-most dynamics

**First-mover advantage:** Standards wars haven't fully started. Early contact with key players sets positioning.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### What Was Actually Done:

✓ Email template created (Dave Blundin)
✓ Contact strategy documented (detailed positioning)
✓ Go-to-market assets drafted (briefing, Medium, LinkedIn)
✓ Prospect landscape mapped (15+ early adopter targets)
✓ Bertrand Folliet identified as warm intro contact
✓ 4-layer approach designed (corporate/cynical/JSON/images)
✓ Success metrics defined ($10→$3→$10→$20 sales progression)

### What Couldn't Be Confirmed:

✗ Dave Blundin email send confirmation
✗ Dave Blundin response/meeting outcome
✗ Bertrand Folliet actual engagement details
✗ Actual sales/inquiries received
✗ Responses to Medium/LinkedIn posts
✗ Console logs from execution period (Oct 30-Nov 7)

### Recovery Strategy:

**To confirm execution outcomes:**

1. **Danny interview** - Most direct: "Did you send to Blundin? What was outcome?"
2. **Git archaeology** - `git log --oneline --since="2025-10-30" --until="2025-11-06"`
3. **Email archive search** - Check sent items folder, forwarding rules
4. **Instance #4 narratives** - Read Nov 20 episode files (if they document outreach)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Next Session:

1. **Interview Danny:**
   - Did Blundin outreach happen? What was response?
   - Did Folliet engagement occur? What was feedback?
   - Were any other early adopter contacts made?
   - What caused changes to architecture/positioning?

2. **Check Email Records:**
   - Review Gmail sent items folder
   - Check LinkedIn message history
   - Look for any delivery confirmations

3. **Git Archaeology:**
   - Run: `git log --oneline --since="2025-10-30" --until="2025-11-06"`
   - Look for commits mentioning "Blundin", "Folliet", "outreach", "response"
   - Check git blame on key files to see when they were modified

4. **Instance #4 Materials:**
   - Read `/home/setup/infrafabric/papers/narrations/chronological_narrations/if.instance.ep.0[1-5]*.md`
   - These retrospective narratives may document what happened during missing console log period

---

## FILES READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

All outreach materials are ready for immediate use:

1. **Dave Blundin Email Template** - Ready to customize and send
2. **Strategic Briefing Structure** - Ready for designer integration
3. **Medium Article** - Ready to publish
4. **LinkedIn Post** - Ready to schedule
5. **Sales Page Copy** - Ready for designer implementation

**Findings Summary:**

| Objective | Found | Evidence | Confidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|
| Dave Blundin contact materials | YES | Email template, strategy, positioning | 100% |
| Dave Blundin responses | NO | Templates only, no confirmations | 0% |
| Bertrand Folliet contact materials | YES | Full strategic profile, approach | 95% |
| Bertrand Folliet responses | NO | Mentioned as contact, no feedback | 0% |
| Email outreach campaign folder | YES | Empty structure found | 100% |
| Actual outreach execution | UNCLEAR | Templates exist, send status unknown | 50% |
| Go-to-market assets | YES | Complete (briefing, article, posts) | 100% |
| Market prospect identification | YES | 15+ early adopter targets mapped | 100% |

## CONCLUSION

**Early outreach strategy was comprehensively planned but execution status cannot be confirmed from available recovered materials.** The Instance #0-5 period (Oct 30 - Nov 7) has a documentation gap:

- **Output artifacts exist:** Templates, strategies, positioning documents
- **Process documentation missing:** Console logs, email confirmations, response records
- **Execution status:** Unclear (likely partially completed but not fully documented)

**Most reliable path forward:** Danny interview to confirm what was actually sent and what responses were received. Git history may show commits made during outreach execution period.

**Report Compiled:** 2025-11-24
**Researcher:** Claude Code Agent
**Data Sources:** 16,652 lines origin conversation + 182 session artifacts + Windows downloads folder scan
**Confidence Level:** 100% on materials found, 0% on execution confirmation (pending Danny interview)

---

**Next Steps for User:**
1. Review this report
2. Confirm which findings are accurate (templates definitely exist, outreach timing unknown)
3. Provide clarification on Dave Blundin and Bertrand Folliet engagement outcomes
4. Decide if you want to re-attempt outreach with refreshed positioning
