================================================================================
INSTANCE #12 READINESS
================================================================================

Status: READY FOR CONTEXT RETRIEVAL

To retrieve context in Instance #12, use:
  redis-cli GET instance:11:context:full          # Full context
  redis-cli GET instance:11:papers:research       # Research papers
  redis-cli GET instance:11:papers:medium         # Medium articles
  redis-cli GET instance:11:narrations            # Narration episodes
  redis-cli GET instance:11:deployment            # Deployment info
  redis-cli GET instance:11:handover              # Handover tasks

Or retrieve all keys at once:
  redis-cli KEYS instance:11:* | xargs -I {} redis-cli GET {}

Quick verification:
  redis-cli KEYS instance:11:*          # Should return 6 keys
  redis-cli DBSIZE                      # Should include new instance data
  redis-cli INFO memory                 # Check memory usage

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INSTANCE #12
================================================================================

1. START SESSION BY READING REDIS KEYS
   - Begin with: redis-cli GET instance:11:handover
   - Then read: redis-cli GET instance:11:context:full
   - Reference: Other keys as needed

2. IMMEDIATE TASKS (Priority order from handover)
   - Verify Medium publication status
   - Monitor engagement metrics
   - Implement publication schedule
   - Respond to reader feedback
   - Update documentation

3. GIT HOUSEKEEPING
   - Verify 5 pending commits: git status
   - Push to origin: git push origin yologuard/v3-publish
   - Create tag: git tag v3.0-instance11-complete

4. DOCUMENTATION
   - Update agents.md with Instance #11 completion
   - Add Medium series links to README
   - Archive SESSION-RESUME.md

5. CLEANUP
   - Archive narration episodes to cold storage
   - Create new /chronological_narrations/ for Instance #12
   - Update COMPONENT-INDEX.md
