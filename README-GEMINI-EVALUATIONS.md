## Gemini's Final Recommendation

**STATUS: GO** (with caution on business materials)

**Confidence levels:**
- ✅ High (>90%): Philosophy, papers, narrative, bug fixes
- ⚠️ Medium (70-90%): Performance claims (hardware-dependent)
- ❌ Low (<70%): Long-term Gemini free tier stability (policy-dependent)

**Critical actions:**
1. Publish immediately (papers ready)
2. Complete marketing in 2-3 weeks (competitive matrix critical)
3. Approach partners in 4-6 weeks (once materials ready)
4. Monitor API policy changes weekly (high risk)
