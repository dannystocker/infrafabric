> Vous pouvez être le consultant qui dit 'oui, je peux' — et générer €100K-€300K par an en frais de consultation. C'est une nouvelle capacité, pas une disruption.

> 15 minutes pour voir en direct ?"

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] He says "yes" to 15-min follow-up call

## ⚠️ POTENTIAL OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES

### "This sounds too good to be true. What's the catch?"

**Response:** "Fair question. We've validated this on production systems. Test #1B: 60.5 minutes productivity saved (vs. 43-min claim). Citation accuracy: 94%. We're not asking you to take risk—14-day pilot with your client proves it before any commitment."

### "My clients won't adopt this. They like their current setup."

**Response:** "Exactly—until they see their API bills spike again. Positioning: not 'new system,' but 'how to save 70% on API costs while improving governance.' That's an easy conversation. Our demo is designed to make that case for you."

### "I already work with consultants. Why should I partner with you?"

**Response:** "You don't compete with them—you enhance your offering. You become the consultant who says yes when clients ask 'how do we manage our AI costs intelligently?' That's a new competitive advantage. Plus, you capture 30-50% of the consulting fees. Revenue, not risk."

### "What if InfraFabric doesn't work for my clients?"

**Response:** "14-day pilot. We implement with one of your clients, measure results, see if it works. If it doesn't hit targets, you've lost only 14 days. If it does (and we think it will), you have a new service and revenue stream."

### "How much time will this require from me?"

**Response:** "First client: 4-6 weeks from you (you lead client conversations, we handle tech). After that: 5-10 hours/week for support + pitching new clients. You scale gradually. Not a full-time role."
