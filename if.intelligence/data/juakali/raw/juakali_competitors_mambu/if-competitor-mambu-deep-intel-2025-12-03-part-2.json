COMPANY INTELLIGENCE\n\n### 3.1 Funding & Valuation History\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mambu\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Company Intelligence - Funding\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**FUNDING ROUNDS:**\n\n**Series E - December 9, 2021**\n- **Amount:** €235 million ($265.4M USD)\n- **Valuation:** €4.9 billion ($5.5B USD)\n- **Lead Investor:** EQT Growth\n- **Significance:** Largest financing round for a banking software platform in Europe\n- **Notes:** Made Mambu one of highest-valued B2B SaaS companies founded in Europe\n\n**Series D - January 7, 2021**\n- **Amount:** €110 million ($135M USD)\n- **Pre-Money Valuation:** €1.6B\n- **Post-Money Valuation:** €1.7B+\n- **Lead Investor:** TCV\n- **Participants:** Tiger Global, Arena Holdings, Bessemer Venture Partners, Runa Capital, Acton Capital Partners\n\n**TOTAL FUNDING:** $445-446M across all rounds\n\n**KEY INVESTORS:**\n- EQT Growth (Series E lead)\n- TCV (Series D lead)\n- Tiger Global Management\n- Bessemer Venture Partners (most recent investor)\n- Runa Capital\n- Acton Capital Partners\n- Arena Holdings\n- Plug and Play Tech Center\n\n**REVENUE ESTIMATES (conflicting sources):**\n- $128.6M (Getlatka 2024)\n- $159.5M (Growjo 2024)\n- Generates $15M more revenue than Thought Machine (competitor)\n- Only 9.30% of Temenos's revenue\n\n**CRITICAL ANALYSIS:**\n\nThe massive $5.5B valuation was achieved during the 2021 fintech boom. Given:\n- Employee growth: 0% YoY (2024)\n- Revenue growth slowing to 9% YoY\n- Quarterly layoffs reported on Glassdoor\n- No Series F announced (3+ years since Series E)\n\nThis suggests Mambu may be overvalued and struggling to justify unicorn status. The lack of follow-on funding despite a $5.5B valuation is a red flag.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2 Executive Leadership Team\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.cbinsights.com/company/mambu/people\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Company Intelligence - Leadership\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CURRENT CEO:**\n- **Fernando Zandona** - Appointed May 1, 2023\n- Background: 20+ years at Amazon and Microsoft\n- Deep technical insight from hyper-growth environments\n\n**FOUNDERS (2011):**\n- **Eugene Danilkis** - Former CEO (now Board of Directors)\n- **Frederik Pfisterer** - Co-founder\n- **Sofia Nunes** - Co-founder\n\n**KEY EXECUTIVES:**\n\n- **Ivneet Kaur** - Chief Technology and Product Officer (joined December 2024)\n- **Semhal Tarekegn O'Gorman** - Chief Customer Success Officer (joined Feb 2024, promoted to CCO)"
