This suggests:\n\n1. Hiring freeze following Series E\n2. Layoffs offsetting new hires (Glassdoor \"quarterly layoffs\")\n3. Inability to scale organization despite massive funding\n4. Potential burn rate issues\n\nA SaaS company at $159M revenue should be growing headcount 20-30% annually if healthy. 0% growth + layoffs = trouble.\n\n---\n\n### 3.5 Strategic Partnerships\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** Multiple sources\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Company Intelligence - Partnerships\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CLOUD PARTNERSHIPS:**\n\n1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**\n   - Primary cloud infrastructure provider\n   - 200+ mutual customers (Esperanza, TymeBank, New10)\n   - AWS Partner Network (APN) Technology Partner status\n   - Services used: EKS, RDS, Elasticache, Lambda, Cloud Run\n\n2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**\n   - Available on GCP Marketplace\n   - Bank Jago first customer to leverage Mambu-GCP partnership\n   - Kubernetes (GKE), Compute Engine initially, now moving to serverless\n\n3. **Microsoft Azure**\n   - Available on Azure Marketplace\n   - Less prominent than AWS/GCP partnerships\n\n**SYSTEM INTEGRATION PARTNERS:**\n\n1. **Persistent Systems** - Preferred integration partner since 2016\n2. **Deloitte** - Data Migration Tool with pre-built transformations\n3. **GFT** - BankStart accelerator (6-month digital bank deployment)\n4. **Specific-Group** - European banking focus (UniCredit, LBBW, BMW Bank, Raiffeisenbank)\n5. **TrueNorth** - Fintech software development\n6. **ABC TECH Group** - Integration partner\n7. **Finplus** - Main consulting/SI partner for Africa implementations\n\n**TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS:**\n\n- **Backbase** - Digital banking engagement platform (pre-integrated)\n- **Marqeta** - Card issuing and processing\n- **Currencycloud** - Cross-border payments and FX\n- **ComplyAdvantage** - AML/KYC screening\n- **nCino** - Loan origination\n- **Wise** - International payments\n- **BankBI** - Analytics and reporting platform (60+ clients, 40 countries)\n\n**RECENT PARTNERSHIP NEWS:**\n\n- **December 2024:** Acquired Numeral (French payment technology provider)\n- **May 2025:** Launched Mambu Payments (extending beyond core)\n- **2024:** Launched Mambu Functions on AWS\n- **2024:** GFT BankStart accelerator partnership\n\n**COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:**\n\nMambu's partnership strategy is strong, particularly with AWS. However, the December 2024 Numeral acquisition suggests Mambu lacks native payment capabilities and must buy rather than build. This raises questions about their \"composable\" platform claims.\n\n---\n\n## 4.
