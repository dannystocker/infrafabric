Create Mambu users with appropriate permissions\n2. Add organization branches\n3. Configure products and settings\n\n**Migration Methods:**\n\n**Method 1: API-Based (Recommended)**\n- Use Mambu APIs for programmatic data import\n- Supports all product types including:\n  - Dynamic Loan Schedules\n  - Revolving Credit Loans\n  - Complex account structures\n- Best for large-scale migrations\n- Enables automation and validation\n\n**Method 2: Excel Template**\n- Provided Excel template for manual import\n- **Limitations:** Does NOT support Dynamic Loan Schedules or Revolving Credit Loans\n- Suitable for smaller datasets\n- Less flexible than API\n\n**Process Steps:**\n1. **Extract** data from legacy system\n2. **Prepare** data for Mambu format\n3. **Submit** via API or Excel\n4. **Validate** - Mambu automatically validates submission\n5. **Review** and make corrections\n6. **Confirm** import to complete migration\n\n**MIGRATION PARTNERS:**\n\n- **Deloitte Data Migration Tool** - Pre-built transformations and validation mechanisms\n- **Persistent Systems** - Integration partner supporting migrations\n- **League Data** - Real-world example: 48-hour cutover protocol\n\n**REAL-WORLD MIGRATION TIMELINES:**\n\n- **League Data:** 48 hours for actual cutover after preparation\n- **Carbon Finance (Nigeria):** 1 month full integration\n- **Planning Required:** Based on legacy data volume\n\n**RECOMMENDATIONS:**\n\n- Schedule after business hours when possible (performance impact)\n- Backup all data before migration\n- No migration is risk-free\n- Use API method for complex products\n\n**CASE STUDY: League Data (Canada Credit Unions)**\n\n- Migrated from legacy core banking system to Mambu on AWS\n- Developed 48-hour cutover protocol\n- No disruption to services during migration\n- Majority of operations migrated successfully\n- Systematic preparation phase required before cutover\n\n**LIMITATIONS:**\n\n1. **Performance Impact:** Large migrations can affect system performance\n2. **Excel Template Gaps:** Cannot import all product types via Excel\n3. **Manual Preparation:** Significant data preparation required\n4. **Parallel Running:** BancoEstado case shows years-long parallel operation of legacy and Mambu\n5. **Risk:** \"No migration process is risk-free\" - Mambu's own warning\n\n**COMPETITIVE WEAKNESS:**\n\nFull-scale enterprise migrations (like BancoEstado with 14M customers) take YEARS and require running parallel systems. This contradicts the \"quick implementation\" marketing and limits Mambu's ability to win large legacy bank modernization deals.\n\n---\n\n### 5.5 Customization & Configuration Capabilities\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://support.mambu.com/docs/custom-fields\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Technical Intelligence - Customization\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CONFIGURATION AS CODE (CasC):**\n\n**Capabilities:**\n- YAML-based configuration files\n- Quickly configure new instances\n- Standardize configuration between tenants\n- Duplicate settings for multiple sandboxes\n- Version control for configurations\n\n**Limitations:**\n- PUT requests delete any settings not included (NO PATCH support)\n- Centres configuration limited to references only\n- Linked objects must be configured separately\n- Not all entities fully supported\n\n**CUSTOM FIELDS:**\n\n**Supported Entities:**\n- Clients\n- Groups\n- Centres\n- Loan accounts\n- Deposit accounts\n- Guarantors\n- Assets\n- Lines of credit\n- Branches\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Technical limits per entity (no specific number disclosed)\n- Guarantors and assets: ONE default custom field set only (cannot add more sets)\n- Some client custom field sets NOT fully configurable via CasC\n- Recommended maximum: 50-100 custom field values per entity\n- Entities exceeding limits cannot be updated until values removed\n\n**MAMBU FUNCTIONS:**\n\n**Purpose:** Inject custom TypeScript/JavaScript code into business processes\n\n**Capabilities:**\n- Extend platform functionality beyond out-of-the-box features\n- Customize for unique requirements\n- Reduce time to create custom financial products\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **Memory:** 512MB limit\n- **Execution Timeout:** 1000ms (1 second)\n- **Input Payload:** 6MB hard limit (will not process if exceeded)\n- **Output Constraints:** Specific formats required for strings, numbers, dates, times\n- Not suitable for heavy computational workloads\n\n**EXTENSION POINTS:**\n\n- Predefined hooks in core banking processes\n- Allows custom logic injection at specific points\n- Limited to Mambu-defined extension points\n\n**CONFIGURATION SCOPE:**\n\n**Configurable:**\n- Products (loans, deposits, cards)\n- Interest calculation methods\n- Fee structures\n- Branches and centres\n- User roles and permissions\n- Workflows\n- Custom fields\n- Currencies and exchange rates\n\n**Not Configurable / Limited:**\n- Core accounting logic\n- Some client entity custom fields\n- Guarantors/assets custom field sets\n- Technical infrastructure\n- API endpoints\n- Database schema\n\n**USER FEEDBACK ON CUSTOMIZATION:**\n\nNegative:\n- \"The customization options are somewhat limited\" (PeerSpot review)"
