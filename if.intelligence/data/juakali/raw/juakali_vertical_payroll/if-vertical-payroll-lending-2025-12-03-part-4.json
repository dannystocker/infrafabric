lobby for API access; partner with payroll vendors\n\n2. **Data Security:**\n   - Risk: Government employee data is sensitive; breaches = regulatory penalties\n   - Mitigation: ISO 27001 certification; encryption at rest and in transit; regular audits\n\n3. **System Downtime:**\n   - Risk: Payroll system downtime during month-end (critical period)\n   - Mitigation: 99.9% SLA; redundant infrastructure; queue-based processing\n\n### Regulatory Risks\n\n1. **Licensing Requirements:**\n   - Risk: CBK (Kenya), CBN (Nigeria), BOG (Ghana) may require lender licenses\n   - Mitigation: Position as SaaS provider (not lender); partner with licensed institutions\n\n2. **Rate Cap Changes:**\n   - Risk: Sudden rate cap imposition (Kenya 2016-2019 precedent)\n   - Mitigation: Configurable compliance engine; auto-alerts for regulatory changes\n\n3. **Data Privacy:**\n   - Risk: GDPR-equivalent laws (Kenya Data Protection Act, Nigeria NDPR, South Africa POPIA)\n   - Mitigation: Legal counsel in each country; consent workflows; right-to-erasure features\n\n### Market Risks\n\n1. **Competitive Response:**\n   - Risk: Craft Silicon, Titansoft, Lendsqr build payroll integrations\n   - Mitigation: First-mover advantage; exclusive partnerships with payroll systems; network effects (loan registry)\n\n2. **Economic Downturn:**\n   - Risk: Government salary freezes or cuts reduce borrowing capacity\n   - Mitigation: Diversify across 11 countries; focus on essential workers (teachers, healthcare)\n\n3. **Disintermediation:**\n   - Risk: Governments offer direct salary advances (Ghana PSC proposal 2024)\n   - Mitigation: White-label solution for government HR departments;
