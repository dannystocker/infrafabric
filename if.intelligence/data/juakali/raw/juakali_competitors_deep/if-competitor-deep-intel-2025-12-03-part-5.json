  "content": "| **Hidden Costs** | Customization for complex MFI needs | Inferred | Medium |\n| **Value Proposition** | Cloud-native = no on-prem infrastructure costs | Oradian.com | High |\n| **Pricing Philosophy** | Not disclosed | - | Low |\n\n**Competitive Advantages:**\n- 24/7 SLA-based support (vs. Mifos community-only, Musoni business hours)\n- Dedicated CSM + Product Adoption Team (premium service model)\n- Regular training/reviews included (reduces TCO vs. à la carte support)\n- Cloud-native eliminates on-prem costs\n\n**Competitive Vulnerabilities:**\n- **\"Costly\" perception in customer reviews** (major barrier)\n- No pricing transparency = long sales cycles\n- \"Not variable for small clients\" = excludes small MFI market\n- Nigerian customers complain about Naira devaluation impact (currency mismatch)\n- Setup fee + monthly sub = high upfront cost vs. Musoni's pure subscription\n- \"Longer implementation\" = slower time-to-value vs. Musoni's <3 months\n\n## B.

Or struggling to raise?)\n- 67 employees across 3 continents = very thin (Mambu has 187 engineers alone)\n- Compensation down 8% in last 12 months = retention risk\n- \"Very weak\" benefits = talent attraction problem vs. Mambu/big tech\n- Fast-paced/tight deadlines = potential burnout (vs. better-funded competitors)\n- Limited resources = feature velocity constrained\n- 20 investors for $138K = each invested ~$7K avg (angel/friends-family round, not institutional)\n\n## D.
