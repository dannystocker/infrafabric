Licensing through Ministry of Finance with COBAC approval required\n2. Minimum capital: FCFA 500 million for payment service providers\n3. Strong network presence required (390 licensed MFIs, highly competitive)\n4. Mobile money tax: 0.2% + 4 FCFA fixed fee (as of Jan 2025)\n5. Software import duty: 10% (as of Jan 2025)\n\n**DRC:**\n1. BCC licensing for financial services technology\n2. De-dollarization policy creating currency complexity\n3. Geographic concentration (70% in 3 provinces: Kinshasa, North Kivu, South Kivu)\n4. Infrastructure challenges (connectivity, power)\n5. 85-90% of banking sector still dollarized despite policy push\n\n### OPPORTUNITIES:\n\n**Cameroon:**\n1. 390 licensed MFIs need software solutions\n2. Government push for digital transformation\n3. Financial inclusion rate growing (27.8% to 33.1%, 2018-2022)\n4. Technology sector tax incentives (25% reduction)\n5. Regional hub position in CEMAC\n\n**DRC:**\n1. Large underserved market (only 11% formal banking access)\n2. National Payment Switch integration opportunities\n3. Mobile money dominance (46% Vodacom, 37.5% Airtel)\n4. Government committed to financial inclusion strategy\n5. 102 MFIs needing modernization\n\n### REGULATORY RISKS:\n\n**Both Countries:**\n1. COBAC/BCC can withdraw licenses for non-compliance\n2. AML/CFT requirements strict (GABAC oversight)\n3. NPL crisis in Cameroon (14.3% in 2024)\n4. Consumer protection regulations increasingly enforced\n5. Data localization and privacy requirements\n\n### CEMAC ADVANTAGES:\n1. Single license can operate across 6 countries (as of Jan 2025)\n2. Harmonized OHADA business law\n3. Fixed CFA/Euro exchange rate (stability)\n4. Regional payment infrastructure (GIMAC)\n5. BEAC Credit Bureau project underway\n\n---\n\n**END OF INTELLIGENCE REPORT**\n**Total Documents Retrieved: 58**\n**Coverage: Cameroon (25), DRC (25), CEMAC Regional (8)**\n"
