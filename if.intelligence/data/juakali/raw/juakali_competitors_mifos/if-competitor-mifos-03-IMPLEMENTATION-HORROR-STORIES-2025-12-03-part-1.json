For Conflux, once the standard format (MS Access) and the scripts to push data into Mifos (VB scripts) are available, running the scripts is **no more than 5-10% of the total effort**.\"\n\n**Translation**: 90-95% of migration effort is data cleanup. The \"easy\" part is only 5-10%.\n\n### Manual Migration Nightmare\n\n> \"Manually migrating group data **cannot be done correctly** without modifying the system date where the application is running or by somehow modifying the data directly on the database after the group has being created and activated.\"\n> — Mifos documentation\n\n**Impact**: Requires either:\n1. Dangerous system date manipulation\n2. Direct database hacking\n3. Neither is acceptable for production systems\n\n### Migration Timeline Reality\n\n**Example Project**:\n- **Duration**: 2 weeks (with active MFI participation)\n- **Process**: MFI personnel actively participated in cleansing activity\n- **Testing**: Manual testing of migrated data with loan officer\n- **Rollback**: Manual rollback required in case of errors\n\n**Red Flag**: \"Manual\" everything - testing, rollback, verification\n\n### The \"Tons of Little Details\" Problem\n\n> \"No major issues came up as problems, but there have been **tons of little details**...things like:\n> - Fields we don't want to be mandatory that currently are\n> - Not being able to disburse loans for a future date\n> - Meeting schedules\n>\n> But we found a solution for all of them, **one by one**.\"\n> — Implementation partner\n\n**Translation**: Death by a thousand cuts. Every single issue requires workaround.\n\n## INSTALLATION & SETUP FAILURES\n\n### Ubuntu Installation Issues\n\n**User Report**: \"Issues on Ubuntu 18.04 during Step 4\"\n\n**Problem**: Running `sudo apt-get install npm nodejs-legacy`\n**Error**: \"Package nodejs-legacy is not available\"\n\n**Impact**: Installation guide doesn't match current Ubuntu versions. Dead in the water.\n\n### FFI Gem Installation Failure\n\n**Error**: \"An error occurred while installing ffi (1.15.3), and Bundler cannot continue.\"\n\n**Impact**: Cannot complete Ruby dependencies installation. Installation blocked.\n\n### Pentaho Reports Directory Missing\n\n**Problem**: If `/pentahoReports` not copied into `/root/.mifosx`, accounting reports fail\n\n**Error**: \"Unable to create key\" for report files\n\n**Impact**:\n- Accounting reports broken\n- Non-obvious error message\n- Requires deep technical knowledge to diagnose\n- Common mistake in installations\n\n### ClassNotFoundException Horror\n\n**Error**: \"ClassNotFoundException org.apache.catalina.core.JasperListener\"\n\n**Fix**: Manually remove corresponding line from server.xml\n\n**Impact**: Requires editing Tomcat configuration files. Not for the faint of heart.\n\n### The Credentials Confusion\n\n**User Report - Stack Overflow**:\n> \"I have tried installing Mifos X on XAMPP. It's worked as I could access the UI on my browser but **I had lots of problems with the credentials**\"\n\n**Problem**: Setting MySQL passwords differently from suggested defaults breaks everything\n\n**Impact**: Documentation assumes specific passwords. Deviation = failure.\n\n## API & BACKEND NIGHTMARES\n\n### Version 1.12.1 API Failure\n\n**User Report**: \"Fineract API not running on localhost:8080\"\n\n**Details**:\n- Works with version 1.11.0\n- Fails with 1.12.1 release candidate\n- No clear explanation why\n\n**Impact**: Upgrade breaks API. Stuck on old version.\n\n### Version 1.12.0 Complete Failure\n\n**Official Statement**:\n> \"Version 1.12.0 had **build+test issues and was discarded**. Users are recommended to use 1.12.1 instead.\"\n\n**Impact**: Entire release version unusable. If you deployed 1.12.0, start over.\n\n### The 404 Error Mystery\n\n**User Report**: \"App receives 404 errors while trying to access the backend at https://ip:8443/fineract-provider\"\n\n**Context**: Following official installation guide for Ubuntu 20.04 server\n\n**Impact**: Complete connection failure between frontend and backend. System non-functional.\n\n### Pentaho + Gradle Compilation Failure\n\n**Problem**: Missing Pentaho Reporting Engine packages when building with Gradle\n\n**Impact**:\n- Cannot compile project\n- Requires manual dependency resolution\n- Not documented clearly\n\n## CONFIGURATION HELL\n\n### Fineract CN Missing Properties\n\n**Problem**: Following Fineract CN setup guide, encounter missing properties:\n- `fin.keycloak.realm.publicKey`\n- `keycloak.auth-server-url`\n- Other Keycloak-related configurations\n\n**Impact**:\n- Cannot run Postman scripts\n- Authentication setup fails\n- Stuck at initial setup\n\n**Context**: This is following the OFFICIAL setup guide\n\n### Self-Signed Certificate Nightmare\n\n**Problem**: Apache Fineract uses self-signed certificates\n\n**User Experience**:\n- Must manually open https://localhost:8443/fineract-provider/\n- Must accept certificate in browser\n- Must do this BEFORE logging in via UI\n- Browser warnings confuse users\n\n**Impact**:\n- Poor user experience\n- Security warnings alarm users\n- Mobile apps fail to connect\n- Requires expensive SSL certificate for production\n\n## MOBILE APP DISASTERS\n\n### Demo Credentials Don't Work\n\n**Issue #2665 (August 2024)**: Demo credentials not working, login issues\n\n**Impact**:\n- New users can't even try the demo\n- First impression = failure\n- 124 open issues on mobile repo\n\n### Login Error - API Version Mismatch\n\n**User Report**:\n> \"Receiving 'Invalid Authentication details where Passed in API request' error when trying to login to Mifos Mobile app\"\n\n**Root Cause**:\n- Latest Fineract version has problems receiving requests from apps\n- Web-Self service app can ONLY connect to MifosX Release 18.03.01 and 17.07.01\n- Changes in latest build MifosX 21.07.01 broke compatibility\n\n**Impact**:\n- App can't connect to latest backend\n- Forced to use old backend versions\n- Security vulnerabilities in old versions\n- Catch-22 situation\n\n### The API Endpoint Apocalypse\n\n**Problem**: Mifos X Android app pointing to old API endpoint `https://[ip]/mifosng-provider/api/v1`\n\n**Impact**:\n- Users who upgraded to Fineract platform = broken app\n- Field agents can't use application\n- Invested gadgets (tablets, phones) = useless\n\n**User Quote**:\n> \"This is a major issue affecting many MFIs whose field agents couldn't use the application, **rendering their invested gadgets unusable**.\"\n\n### App Freezing on Transactions\n\n**Problem**: App freezes whenever users make savings withdrawal or deposit\n\n**Impact**:\n- Core functionality broken\n- Cannot process transactions\n- Field operations disrupted\n\n### App Crashing After PIN Entry\n\n**Problem**: App crashes after entering PIN correctly, even with active internet connection\n\n**Impact**:\n- Cannot access app\n- Authentication works but app fails\n- No error message to help diagnose\n\n## PENTAHO REPORTING DISASTERS\n\n### Parameter Configuration Data Integrity Issue\n\n**Common Error**: \"parameterName\":null,\"value\": null,\"args\"\n\n**Cause**: Parameter provided in SQL query but not configured in Mifos - Create report\n\n**Impact**:\n- Reports fail to run\n- Non-obvious error message\n- Requires understanding of both SQL and Mifos configuration\n- \"Data integrity\" error is misleading\n\n### Version Compatibility Hell\n\n**Problem**: \"Due to updates of a number of dependencies, it's not possible to run pentaho reports with certain version combinations\"\n\n**Impact**:\n- Working reports suddenly break after upgrade\n- Must match exact Pentaho version to Mifos version\n- Pentaho 3.9.1-GA recommended but may not work with all versions\n- Trial and error to find compatible versions\n\n### MySQL Strict Mode Breaks Reports\n\n**Problem**: MySQL version comes with preset conditions that break Pentaho reports\n\n**Workaround**: Create `/etc/mysql/conf.d/disable_strict_mode.cnf` with custom sql_mode settings\n\n**Impact**:\n- Requires MySQL server configuration changes\n- Must disable security features\n- Not documented in main installation guide\n- Database administrator knowledge required\n\n### Report Parsing Failures\n\n**Problem**: \"Pentaho reports cannot be parsed successfully\" when running accounting reports\n\n**Impact**:\n- Accounting reports completely broken\n- No financial reporting\n- Audit nightmare\n- Compliance issues\n\n### The Missing Logo Error\n\n**Error**: \"Unable to create key: No loader was able to handle the given key data\" for MIfosX_unofficial_logo.png\n\n**Cause**: Path isn't correct\n\n**Workaround**: Manually place logo inside pentahoReports folder with exact filename\n\n**Impact**:\n- Reports fail for missing image\n- Cryptic error message\n- Requires file system manipulation\n- Easy to miss in setup\n\n### Blank Page of Death\n\n**User Report**: \"Successfully installed Mifos but when running pentaho reports get a blank page\"\n\n**Cause**: \"Application is returning the Pentaho report, but UI is not showing the output\"\n\n**Impact**:\n- Reports generated but not visible\n- Backend works, frontend fails\n- No error message\n- Appears to be working but isn't\n\n## UPGRADE & MIGRATION HORRORS\n\n### Failed Upgrade Error\n\n**Error**: \"Migration of schema failed!\" during Mifos X upgrade\n\n**Required Steps**:\n1. Stop Tomcat server\n2. Manual database intervention\n3. Restart\n4. Pray\n\n**Impact**: Upgrade process is dangerous and can brick the system\n\n### The Flyway to Liquibase Migration\n\n**Major Breaking Change**:\n- Flyway used until Fineract 1.6.x\n- Liquibase required from 1.7.0 onwards\n- PostgreSQL support added, requiring database-independent migration\n\n**Impact**:\n- Cannot directly upgrade from pre-1.6 to post-1.7\n- Must go through 1.6.0 as intermediate step\n- Migration scripts may not run\n- Manual intervention required\n\n### Unique Constraint Name Mismatch\n\n**Specific Issue FINERACT-1930**: Migration script 0016_changed_unique_constraint_of_ref_no.xml failed while migrating from 1.6.0 to 1.8.4\n\n**Cause**: Mismatch of unique constraint name in m_savings_account_transaction table\n\n**Impact**:\n- Upgrade blocked\n- Requires manual database schema inspection\n- Must manually fix constraint names\n- High risk of data corruption\n\n### MariaDB Upgrade Failure\n\n**Problem**: \"Upgrading database from MySQL 5.7 as advised to Maria DB 10.6, fails\"\n\n**Details**:\n- Data from version 18.03.01 fails to migrate\n- Databases running on 1.5.0 release complete startup BUT login fails\n\n**Impact**:\n- Stuck on old database version\n- Cannot follow upgrade recommendations\n- Security vulnerabilities in old MySQL versions\n\n### Timezone Hell\n\n**Problem**: \"If a previously used Fineract instance didn't run in UTC (backward compatibility), all prior dates will be read wrongly by MySQL\"\n\n**Impact**:\n- Database migration scripts produce incorrect data\n- Historical data corrupted\n- Loan schedules calculated incorrectly\n- Financial reporting inaccurate\n\n### Intermittent Build Failures After Upgrade\n\n**User Report**: \"We recently migrated our application from Fineract 1.4 to Fineract 1.9. After addressing all conflicts and successfully executing migration scripts, application is running smoothly without functional issues. **However**, intermittent issue during build process.\"\n\n**Details**: Failures typically related to Fineract Avro dependencies\n\n**Impact**:\n- Unpredictable build failures\n- Deployment delays\n- CI/CD pipeline broken\n- Developer frustration\n\n## PERFORMANCE NIGHTMARES\n\n### Single-Threaded Scheduler\n\n**Problem**: \"The scheduler jobs are single threaded, meaning no two jobs can be executed parallelly\"\n\n**Impact**:\n- Performance bottleneck\n- Jobs queue up\n- Batch processing slow\n- Overnight jobs may not complete\n\n### The Query That Takes Forever\n\n**Problem**: \"For a large organization containing millions of transactions, for the defined period set the backend processing query **takes forever to complete** the processing\"\n\n**Impact**:\n- Reports timeout\n- UI becomes unresponsive\n- Users think system crashed\n- Operational paralysis\n\n### HTTP 413 Payload Too Large\n\n**Problem**: \"For field app users to gain access to large set of data, owing to size of http response body '413 Payload Too Large' errors could occur\"\n\n**Impact**:\n- Cannot sync field data\n- Mobile app broken for large datasets\n- Field operations disrupted\n- Data usage \"considerably high\"\n\n## COLLECTION SHEET DEPRECATION CONTROVERSY\n\n### The Microfinance Abandonment\n\n**Community Member Quote (August 2024)**:\n> \"The influx of new features in Fineract is that these are predominantly **not for microfinance or small entities, which Mifos once set out to support**. [We] see the deprecation of the Collection Sheet feature in this context.\"\n\n**Implication**: Apache Fineract moving away from microfinance focus\n\n**Mifos Response**:\n> \"Regardless of what decision the Fineract community makes in regards to deprecation of collection sheet functionality, **Mifos will not be removing this functionality** nor diminishing its focus on microfinance and financial inclusion within the Mifos X distribution.\"\n\n**Impact**:\n- Split between Fineract and Mifos directions\n- Uncertainty about future features\n- Core microfinance functionality at risk\n- Must rely on Mifos Initiative, not Apache\n\n## STACK OVERFLOW CRY FOR HELP\n\n### Top Questions Reveal Pain Points\n\n1. **\"Run/Debug Apache Fineract using Eclipse?\"**\n   - Answer: \"Only way is running embedded Gradle task and attaching remote debugger\"\n   - Translation: Debugging is a nightmare\n\n2. **\"Fineract CN Basic Setup\"**\n   - Missing Keycloak properties\n   - Cannot complete basic setup\n   - Following official guide\n\n3. **\"Combining Fineract on backend and mifos UI on front end\"**\n   - Users struggle to connect UI to backend\n   - Should be straightforward but isn't\n   - Errors when integrating\n\n4. **\"How to create moratorium loan in apache finaract\"**\n   - Repayment schedule doesn't show correct interest\n   - Even with 6-month grace periods configured\n   - Core loan functionality broken\n\n5. **\"Apache Fineract Reporting\"**\n   - Must manually add PentahoReportingProcessServiceImpl\n   - Add Pentaho dependencies to dependencies.gradle\n   - Why isn't this automatic?\n\n6. **\"Fineract does not ship Pentaho reports or related libraries due to Apache license compliance issues\"**\n   - Legal issues prevent including key functionality\n   - Users directed to \"Mifos community for distributions\"\n   - Fragmented solution\n\n## THE REAL COST ADMISSION\n\n### Infrastructure Costs (From FAQ)\n\n> \"On the infrastructure side, costs will include:\n> - Connectivity\n> - PCs\n> - Power supplies at the branches\n> - In on-site: cost of server and infrastructure at head office\n> - In hosted: monthly hosting costs\"\n"
