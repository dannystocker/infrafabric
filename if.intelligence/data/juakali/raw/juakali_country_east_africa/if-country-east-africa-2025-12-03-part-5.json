MFI software supporting financial inclusion aligns perfectly with national priorities.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-POL-003\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://statehouse.go.ug/state-of-the-nation-address-2025-by-president-yoweri-kaguta-museveni/\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Political\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: State of Nation Address\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2025\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- President Museveni State of Nation Address 2025\n- Economy more diversified and sophisticated vs 1986\n- Harvard Economic Growth Lab study: Last 10 years, Uganda added 20 new products to export basket\n- Opportunity to harness 50 new complex products\n- GDP per capita: USD 1,263 (growing 6.3% annually)\n- Projected 7% growth 2025/26\n- \"Irreversibly a middle-income country\"\n- Uganda Vision 2040 progress\n- President implored MPs to mobilize Ugandans for wealth creation initiatives\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Strong messaging on \"irreversibly middle-income\" status. 6.3-7% growth is excellent. Diversifying export basket suggests growing SME sector (key MFI target market). Presidential emphasis on wealth creation creates political backing for financial inclusion.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-POL-004\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.finance.go.ug/sites/default/files/2025-06/Budget%20Speech%20FY2025%20web_0.pdf\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Political/Fiscal\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Budget Speech\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2025-06\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- Budget Speech FY 2025/26\n- Economy size: USD 61B (exchange rate method), USD 174B (purchasing power parity)\n- Population: ~45 million\n- No longer least developed country\n- Lower middle-income country status\n- Continued focus on industrialization, agriculture, infrastructure\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Economy USD 61B is larger than Kenya (USD 53B in same year). PPP of USD 174B shows strong domestic purchasing power. Lower middle-income status means growing consumer finance demand.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-POL-005\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.pulse.ug/story/time-to-get-uganda-out-of-financial-stone-age-says-bou-governor-2025112510264680208\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Political/Regulatory\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Governor Speech\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2025-11-25\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- BOU Governor Dr Michael Atingi-Ego keynote at 3rd Kampala Blockchain Summit\n- \"Time to get Uganda out of financial stone age\"\n- Government determined to roll out comprehensive regulatory framework for Blockchain industry\n- Uganda at crossroads: Lead Africa's digital financial transformation or trail behind\n- Quote: \"We are living in a time when a month in digital innovation can alter the entire business model. Tech once considered theoretical such as tokenised securities, and blockchain cross border payments are now operating in advanced markets.\"\n- \"We need to get Uganda out of the financial stone age.\"\n- Atingi-Ego appointed Governor February 2025 after acting for 2 years following Governor Mutebile's death (January 2022)\n- Positive ratings for steering CBin midst of tough times: Slow COVID recovery, rapid monetary expansion, fiscal indiscipline, corruption scandals\n- PhD from Liverpool University (1996), IMF African Department Deputy Director (2008), started at BOU 1984\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Governor Atingi-Ego is VERY pro-innovation and pro-fintech. \"Financial stone age\" comment is striking - shows frustration with slow digital adoption. Blockchain framework signals openness to cutting-edge technology. This is a fintech-friendly regulator.\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 2: TAX & FISCAL POLICY (3 Documents)\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-TAX-001\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://ura.go.ug/en/download/tax-amendments-2024-25/\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Tax\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Tax Legislation\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024-07-15\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- President assented 19 Bills into law July 15, 2024\n- Including: Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024, VAT (Amendment) Bill 2024, Excise Duty (Amendment) Bill 2024, Tax Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill 2024, Stamp Duty (Amendment) Bill 2024\n- Commencement: July 1, 2024\n- FY 2024/25: No major tax rate changes proposed\n- Revenue generation focus on URA compliance measures\n- Enhanced enforcement\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Relatively stable tax environment for FY 2024/25. Focus on compliance rather than rate increases. However, 19 bills in one package suggests active tax law environment - need to monitor changes carefully.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-TAX-002\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.rfilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Impact-of-Mobile-Money-Taxation-in-Uganda.pdf\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Tax\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Research Report\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2021-11\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- Excise Duty (Amendment) Act 2018 introduced:\n  - Mobile Money Tax: 0.5% on withdrawals (effective 2018-19 FY)\n  - OTT Tax: UGX 200 per day for social media apps (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.)\n- Effective July 1, 2021: OTT 'social media' tax REMOVED, replaced with 12% tax on Internet data\n- Total value of Mobile Money transactions peaked UGX 6.9T (2018), dropped ~UGX 1T after tax\n- URA data: 1% mobile money tax contributed Ush 22B (USD 5.8M), Ush 200 daily social media tax contributed Ush 4.3B (USD 1.1M)\n- March 2024 ICTD Policy Brief: Current mobile money tax system \"widely disliked, unbalanced, arguably distortionary\"\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Uganda experimented with controversial mobile money taxation (0.5% on withdrawals remains). This tax directly hits MFI customers who use mobile money. The OTT/social media tax replaced with 12% internet data tax also affects digital financial services. These taxes create friction in digital financial inclusion - policy advocacy opportunity for sector.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-TAX-003\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/ke/pdf/tax/2024/Uganda%202024-2025%20Budget%20Brief.pdf\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Tax\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Budget Brief\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- KPMG Uganda Budget Brief 2024-2025\n- Analysis of tax measures\n- Corporate income tax: 30% standard rate\n- Covers VAT, excise, withholding tax, other taxes\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: 30% CIT standard (same as Kenya, Tanzania). Need to factor this into pricing models for local operations.\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 3: BOU REGULATIONS (4 Documents)\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-REG-001\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.bou.or.ug/bouwebsite/Supervision/actsandregulations.html\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Regulatory\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Regulatory Framework\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- BOU has mandate to supervise: Commercial Banks, Credit Institutions, Micro Finance Deposit-Taking Institutions (MDIs), Forex Bureaux\n- Acts and Regulations governing supervision:\n  - Micro Deposit Taking Institutions Act 2003\n  - Tier 4 Microfinance Institutions Money Lenders Act 2016\n  - Micro Finance Deposit-Taking Institutions (Revision of Minimum Capital Requirements) Instrument 2024\n  - Micro-Finance Deposit-Taking Institutions Registered Societies Regulations 2023\n- Non-Bank Financial Institutions department supervises: Credit Institutions, MDIs, Forex Bureaus, Money Remitters, NSSF, Deposit Protection Fund, Credit Reference Bureau\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Uganda has simpler regulatory structure than Kenya/Tanzania. Key distinction is MDI (Microfinance Deposit-Taking Institutions) vs Tier 4. 2024 capital requirement revision suggests consolidation pressure. Regulations from 2023 are recent - relatively modern framework.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-REG-002\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.bou.or.ug/bouwebsite/bouwebsitecontent/Supervision/Micro-Finance-Deposit-Taking-Institutions-Registered-Societies-Regulations-2023.pdf\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Regulatory\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Regulations\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2023\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- Statutory Instrument 2023 No. 54\n- Micro-Finance Deposit-Taking Institutions (Registered Societies) Regulations 2023\n- Governs MDIs structured as registered societies\n- Prudential requirements\n- Governance standards\n- Reporting obligations\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: 2023 regulations are very recent. MDI software must comply with these updated standards. Registered societies structure suggests cooperative/member-owned model.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-REG-003\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://archive.bou.or.ug/bou/supervision/overview.html\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Regulatory\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Supervisory Overview\n**CERTAINTY**: medium\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- BOU supervisory approach overview\n- Risk-based supervision methodology\n- On-site and off-site surveillance\n- Early warning systems\n- Corrective action framework\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Risk-based supervision means BOU focuses on higher-risk institutions. Software with strong risk management and early warning capabilities can help MDIs stay off BOU's watchlist.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-REG-004\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://umra.go.ug/licensed-tier-4-microfinance-institutions-and-money-lenders-as-of-march-2022/\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Regulatory\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Regulatory List\n**CERTAINTY**: medium\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2022-03\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- Uganda Microfinance Regulatory Authority (UMRA) regulates Tier 4 MFIs and Money Lenders\n- List of licensed Tier 4 institutions as of March 2022\n- Separate regulator from BOU (which regulates MDIs)\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Uganda has UMRA for Tier 4 (separate from BOU). This is unique in the region. Two regulators means potentially different software requirements for MDIs vs Tier 4 MFIs.\n\n---\n\n### SECTION 4: MFI SECTOR DATA (3 Documents)\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-DATA-001\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_microfinance_deposit-taking_institutions_in_Uganda\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Sector Data\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Institution List\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024-01-19\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- As of January 19, 2024: 3 licensed MDIs\n  1. FINCA Uganda Limited (MDI)\n  2. PRIDE Microfinance Limited (MDI)\n  3. UGAFODE Microfinance Limited (MDI)\n- EFC Uganda Limited (EFCUL) license withdrawn and institution liquidated by BOU January 19, 2024\n- All 3 MDIs licensed and regulated by Bank of Uganda\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Only 3 licensed MDIs - TINY market compared to Kenya (14) and Tanzania (4). But these 3 likely have significant scale. EFC Uganda liquidation shows BOU is willing to take strong supervisory action. Market concentration means sales strategy should focus on these 3 initially, then expand to Tier 4.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-DATA-002\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://dpf.or.ug/microfinance-deposit-taking-institutionsmdis/\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Sector Data\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Regulatory Information\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- Deposit Protection Fund of Uganda covers MDIs\n- MDI deposits are insured\n- Enhances depositor confidence\n- Links to list of covered institutions\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Deposit insurance for MDIs is important consumer protection. Software should support deposit insurance reporting requirements and disclosures.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT UG-DATA-003\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://ugandafact.com/list-of-microfinance-institutions-in-uganda/\n**COUNTRY**: Uganda\n**CATEGORY**: Sector Data\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Institution Directory\n**CERTAINTY**: medium\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024-2025\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- List of various microfinance institutions in Uganda (MDIs and Tier 4)\n- MDI details: FINCA (pan-African, strong international backing), PRIDE (domestic focus), UGAFODE (4th MDI registered)\n- Multiple Tier 4 MFIs and money lenders\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Beyond the 3 MDIs, there are numerous Tier 4 MFIs (exact number unclear but likely dozens to hundreds based on UMRA list reference). This is a larger market opportunity than just the 3 MDIs suggest.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## RWANDA COUNTRY INTELLIGENCE (15 DOCUMENTS)\n\n### SECTION 1: POLITICAL PRIORITIES (4 Documents)\n\n#### DOCUMENT RW-POL-001\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.paulkagame.rw/inclusive-fintech-forum-remarks-by-president-kagame-kigali-25-february-2025/\n**COUNTRY**: Rwanda\n**CATEGORY**: Political\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Presidential Speech\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2025-02-25\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- President Paul Kagame keynote at Inclusive FinTech Forum 2025 (February 24-26, 2025, Kigali)\n- Second edition of forum\n- Key quote: \"Indeed, with our continent's young and tech-savvy population, Africa can compete with the rest of the world and successfully innovate.

This is TOP-LEVEL political backing. Rwanda-Singapore partnership brings world-class expertise. 80% fintech adoption by 2029 target is extremely ambitious. Nearly tripling of fintech startups shows momentum. 7,500 jobs target suggests significant ecosystem development funding.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT RW-POL-002\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.minecofin.gov.rw/news-detail/government-proposes-frw-56901-billion-budget-for-fy-2024-2025\n**COUNTRY**: Rwanda\n**CATEGORY**: Political/Fiscal\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Budget Speech\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024-05\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- Finance Minister Dr. Uzziel Ndagijimana presented proposed budget to Parliament"
