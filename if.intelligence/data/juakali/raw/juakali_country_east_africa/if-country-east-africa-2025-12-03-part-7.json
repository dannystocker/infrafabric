Now undergoing major transformation (consolidation to District level) after proving the concept.\n\n---\n\n---\n\n## EAC REGIONAL FRAMEWORK (5 DOCUMENTS)\n\n#### DOCUMENT EAC-001\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.eac.int/press-releases/145-financial-sector/3084-eac-monetary-affairs-committee-addresses-regional-economic-challenges-and-progress-towards-the-ea-monetary-union\n**COUNTRY**: EAC Regional\n**CATEGORY**: Regional Framework\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Policy Statement\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024-05-06\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- 27th Ordinary Meeting of EAC Monetary Affairs Committee (MAC) held May 3, 2024, Juba, South Sudan\n- Attendees: Governors and Senior Officials of EAC Partner State Central Banks, EAC Secretariat\n- Deliberations: Global economic outlook, persistent inflationary pressures, climate change ramifications, geopolitical tensions impact on region\n- Progress on East African Monetary Union (EAMU) establishment\n- Emphasis: Harmonize monetary policies, financial regulations, crisis management frameworks\n- Achievements: Adoption of price-based monetary policy frameworks, harmonization of macroeconomic and financial statistics, promotion of cross-border payments systems\n- Revised 2031 deadline for monetary union (pushed back from 2024)\n- Reason for delay: All member states behind schedule on implementing protocols and achieving macroeconomic convergence criteria\n- Central Bank of Somalia welcomed as newest MAC member (Somalia admitted to EAC November 24, 2023, full member March 4, 2024)\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: EAC Monetary Union delayed to 2031 but still progressing. Harmonization of financial regulations means software compliant in one country will increasingly be acceptable in others. Cross-border payment system promotion creates opportunity for regional payment solutions. Somalia joining EAC (2024) opens new market (8th member state). Convergence criteria create predictable regulatory evolution path.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT EAC-002\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.eac.int/monetary-union\n**COUNTRY**: EAC Regional\n**CATEGORY**: Regional Framework\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Policy Overview\n**CERTAINTY**: high\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- EAC Partner States aim to harmonize:\n  - Monetary and fiscal policies\n  - Financial, payment and settlement systems\n  - Financial accounting and reporting practices\n  - Policies and standards on statistical information\n- Establish East African Central Bank\n- Macroeconomic convergence criteria:\n  - Maximum headline inflation: 8%\n  - Maximum budget deficit: 3% of GDP\n  - Foreign exchange reserves: 4.5 months cover\n  - Maximum gross public debt: 50% of GDP\n- EAC: 8 Partner States (Burundi, DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda)\n- Headquarters: Arusha, Tanzania\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Convergence criteria (8% inflation, 3% deficit, 4.5 months reserves, 50% debt) provide clear benchmarks. Most East African countries currently meet or are close to inflation target. Harmonization of financial accounting/reporting means potential for standardized MFI software across region. East African Central Bank establishment would create single regulatory authority - massive simplification for regional operators.\n\n---\n\n#### DOCUMENT EAC-003\n**SOURCE_URL**: https://african.business/2023/01/trade-investment/east-african-community-inches-towards-financial-integration\n**COUNTRY**: EAC Regional\n**CATEGORY**: Regional Framework\n**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Analysis\n**CERTAINTY**: medium\n**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2023-01\n\n**KEY CONTENT**:\n- East African Legislative Assembly (EALA) passed bill establishing East African Financial Services Commission (EAFSC)\n- EAFSC to harmonize financial services regulation in non-banking sectors: Insurance, pensions, capital markets, microfinance\n- Promote regional integration in financial sector\n- Progress towards financial integration ongoing but gradual\n\n**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: EAFSC establishment to cover microfinance is SIGNIFICANT.
