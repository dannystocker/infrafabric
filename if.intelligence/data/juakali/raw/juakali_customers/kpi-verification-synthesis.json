  "content": "[TTT: KPI Claim Verification Framework]\n\nCOMMON MFI SOFTWARE KPI CLAIMS:\n\n1. TURNAROUND TIME (TAT):\n   - Marketing claim pattern: \"Reduce loan approval from 5 days to 2 hours\"\n   - Verification: Requires before/after data from specific customer\n   - INTEGRITY CHECK: Ask for timestamped audit trail from production system\n   - INFERENCE FORMULA: If claimed TAT improvement unverified:\n     Industry average improvement: 40-60% reduction typical\n     Maximum credible: 90% reduction (5 days → 12 hours)\n     Over 90%: Requires exceptional evidence\n\n2. PORTFOLIO AT RISK (PAR):\n   - Marketing claim pattern: \"Reduce PAR30 from 8% to 3%\"\n   - Verification: Requires loan performance data (sensitive)\n   - INTEGRITY CHECK: PAR improvements take 6-12 months to materialize\n   - INFERENCE FORMULA:\n     Industry average PAR30 for African MFIs: 5-10%\n     Software impact range: 10-30% reduction typical\n     Claims of >50% PAR reduction: Requires cohort analysis\n\n3. OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY:\n   - Marketing claim pattern: \"Handle 3x more loans with same staff\"\n   - Verification: Requires headcount and loan volume data\n   - INTEGRITY CHECK: Staff may have been reassigned, not eliminated\n   - INFERENCE FORMULA:\n     Typical automation uplift: 20-40% efficiency gain\n     Claims of >100% gain: Requires process redesign evidence\n\n4. CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST (CAC):\n   - Marketing claim pattern: \"Reduce CAC by 60%\"\n   - Verification: Requires marketing spend and customer data\n   - INTEGRITY CHECK: CAC reduction may reflect maturation, not software\n   - INFERENCE FORMULA:\n     Digital channel CAC vs field: typically 40-70% lower\n     Software-attributed CAC reduction: 10-25% credible range\n\nKPI VERIFICATION CHECKLIST FOR BUYER:\n\n[ ] Request 3 reference customers for calls\n[ ] Ask for anonymized before/after metrics\n[ ] Verify timeline (when deployed vs when metrics measured)\n[ ] Check for confounding factors (market conditions, staffing changes)\n[ ] Request production system audit trail access\n[ ] Compare claims to industry benchmarks\n\nOVERALL KPI CONFIDENCE (Without Direct Access): VERY LOW\n\nMost fintech marketing KPIs are:\n- Cherry-picked from best customers\n- Measured at favorable timepoints\n- Missing denominator context\n- Not independently audited\n\nBUYER RECOMMENDATION:\nDo not trust ANY KPI claim without:\n1. Named customer reference\n2. Before/after data with dates\n3. Independent verification method\n\nCERTAINTY: Very Low (framework only, no actual KPI data)\n"
