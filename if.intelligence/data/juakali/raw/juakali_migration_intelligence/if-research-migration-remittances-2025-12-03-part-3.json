  "content": "Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, fell to the #2 position (behind Egypt). The Nigerian diaspora, concentrated primarily in the United States and United Kingdom, continues to maintain strong ties to their homeland, sending $19.8 billion back in 2024. Although the largest total remittances to the region went to Nigeria ($19.8 billion), which is the second largest sub-Saharan African economy (after South Africa), these transfers accounted for 8 percent of its GDP.\n\nThe $7.2bn 2018 Nigerian Remittance in the United States of America is more than the entire $6.7bn allocated for 2019 capital spending.\n\nRemitSCOPE compiles and shows remittance inflow and outflow data published by Central Banks, broken down at a corridor level. There are currently four countries in Africa that are publishing remittance data broken down by corridor; these are Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco and Senegal.\n\nAs of 2023, Africa received over $100 billion in remittances, amounting to approximately 6% of the continent's GDP. This surpassed both official development assistance ($42 billion) and foreign direct investment (FDI) ($48 billion), highlighting a seismic shift in the region's external financing dynamics.\n\nIn Nigeria, for example, these funds are critical for daily needs, education, and business ventures. Families rely on remittances to pay for schooling, healthcare, and housing, which helps to alleviate poverty and raise living standards.\n\nRemittance prices fell from 9.8 per cent in Q2 2016 to 8.2 per cent in Q1 2025, a drop of 1.6 percentage points. At this rate of progress Africa will fail to meet SDG 10.c which states that remittance prices will not average more than 3 percent by 2030.\n\nA substantial share of Africa's remittance flows continues to move through informal channels, such as hand-carried cash or unregistered transfer systems, particularly evident in the DR Congo, Libya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Nigeria.\n\n---\n\n## DOCUMENT 13: WORLD BANK REMITTANCE PRICES WORLDWIDE 2024\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q124_final.pdf\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Costs\n**REGION:** Global/Africa Focus\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CONTENT:**\nThe transaction cost of remittances to African countries remains higher than any other region. According to Remitscope (which uses World Bank data), the average cost of remissions to Africa was 8.4 percent in the First Quarter of 2024.\n\nOf the 6 corridors with costs above 20 percent in Q1 2024, three originate in Sub-Saharan Africa and four are destined for Sub-Saharan Africa. In Q1 2024, 25 of the 354 corridors did not have any SmaRT qualifying services. Of these 25 corridors, fourteen are destined for Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nIn Q1 2024, South Africa (7.08 percent) is the most expensive country in the G20 group to remit to, followed by China (6.61 percent).\n\nThe marginal cost of sending USD200 from South Africa to Mozambique has decreased from 21.76 percent in Q3 2014 to 9.7 percent a decade later. The marginal cost of remittances from South Africa to Zimbabwe has decreased from 17.89 percent in Q3 2014 to 13.18 percent a decade later.\n\nWorld Bank research shows that banks remain the most expensive service providers on African remittance corridors because banks tend to charge a flat fee which is usually a high percentage of the value of the remittance.\n\nAlthough costs are coming down, they are doing so slowly and it is almost certain that the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (No. 10c) of reducing them to below three percent of the value remitted by 2030 will be missed.\n\nIn Q1 2024, the global average for digital remittances was recorded at 4.96 percent, while the global average for non-digital remittances was 6.94 percent.\n\n---\n\n## DOCUMENT 14: WESTERN UNION AND MONEYGRAM MARKET SHARE AFRICA\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://blog.mondato.com/western-union-remittances-competition/\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Providers/Traditional Operators\n**REGION:** Africa/Global\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CONTENT:**\nThe undisputed legacy champion in the remittance field is Western Union, followed by a number of smaller but similar players like MoneyGram & RIA. Although Western Union continues to lead global payments, its market share has diminished due to increasing competition. Western Union continues to maintain its global presence handling just under 12 percent of flows.\n\nMoneyGram stands out as a case study within this evolving marketplace. Once Western Union's main competitor, the company faced performance fluctuations amidst management changes. When the 2009 recession hit, MoneyGram was significantly impacted and lost market share—creating space for new competitors.\n\nThe South Africa Remittance & Cross-Border Transfers Market is characterized by a dynamic mix of regional and international players. Leading participants include The Western Union Company, MoneyGram International Inc., Wise PLC, PayPal Holdings Inc., WorldRemit Group Limited, Remitly Inc., Ria Money Transfer, and regional players like Mukuru Financial Services, Hello Paisa, and Mama Money.\n\nThe South African remittance market is witnessing a surge in digital payment solutions, with over 50% of transactions now conducted online. Innovations such as mobile wallets and peer-to-peer transfer platforms have simplified cross-border transactions.\n\nWestern Union and MoneyGram have had significant presence in Sub-Saharan Africa, with financial arrangements backing remittance receivables, including a $40 million medium-term loan in Ghana backed by Western Union remittance receivables, a $50 million remittance-backed facility for a Nigerian entity using MoneyGram receivables, and a $40 million facility for an Ethiopian bank using Western Union receivables.\n\nBy the last quarter of 2024, the leading competitor was Remitly—a company that began operating in 2013 and reached nearly 23 percent market share by 2024.\n\nThe remittance market is becoming increasingly competitive with fintech companies gaining ground against traditional players like Western Union and MoneyGram, particularly through digital platforms and mobile money services.\n\n---\n\n## DOCUMENT 15: AFRICAN FINTECH REMITTANCE DISRUPTORS\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.techinafrica.com/why-are-remittance-startups-ignoring-the-countries-that-need-them-most/\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Providers/Fintech\n**REGION:** Africa\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CONTENT:**\nIn 2024, Sub-Saharan Africa received $56 billion in remittances. In 2025, Africa's cross-border payments market is valued at $329 billion, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. By 2035, the market is expected to surpass $1 trillion.\n\nLemFi is processing over $1 billion monthly with $53 million in recent funding. LemFi has switched on low-cost transfers to Egypt, its 31st destination, unlocking a remittance corridor that saw Egyptians abroad send $20.6 billion home in 2024. The five-year-old startup now covers three North African markets — Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt — and serves more than two million users worldwide.\n\nUgandan Ham Serunjogi and Ghanaian Maijid Moujaled founded Chipper Cash in 2018, aiming to make cross-border payments as simple as sending a text. Five years on, the company has raised $337.2 million across seven rounds of funding, became a unicorn worth $2 billion, and seen its valuation cut by almost half. According to its website, it has over 5 million users, who can send money to 21 African countries including Malawi and Ethiopia.\n\nWorldRemit is a digital cross border remittance business that provides international money transfer and remittance services in more than 130 countries and over 70 currencies. It was founded in 2010 by Ismail Ahmed, Catherine Wines, and Richard Igoe. The firm has a network of more than 5,000 corridors. It is connected to mobile money services globally, including Zaad (Somaliland), M-Pesa (Kenya), MTN (Africa and Asia), and bKash (Bangladesh).\n\nWell-funded startups like LemFi, NALA, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash compete aggressively for the Nigeria-Kenya-South Africa corridor. LemFi is up against Chipper Cash, WorldRemit, and a growing cast of local fintechs eyeing North Africa's diaspora flows.\n\nThe distribution of fintech innovation across the continent tells a paradoxical story: countries most dependent on remittances receive the least startup attention. The Gambia depends on remittances for over 21% of its GDP. Lesotho and Comoros also sit near the top of the list, with remittances making up around 20% of their economies.\n\nNew entrants face formidable competition from well-capitalized incumbents. Established players like Mukuru, Remitly, WorldRemit, and regional champions have spent years building payout networks, negotiating bank partnerships, and establishing regulatory compliance.\n\nDigital solutions are quickly gaining traction. Since 2020, digital remittances usage has doubled, and Africa now accounts for 71% of mobile remittance value.\n\n---\n\n## DOCUMENT 16: MTN MOMO INTERNATIONAL REMITTANCES\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://momo.mtn.com/remittance/\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Providers/Mobile Money\n**REGION:** Pan-African\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CONTENT:**\nInternational Transfers is a service that allows MoMo customers to send and receive money (cross border payments) to their family, friends, individuals within and across Africa.\n\nMTN's mobile money platform, MoMo, processed $2.1 billion in international remittances across 14 markets in the first half of 2025, demonstrating significant growth in cross-border payments.\n\nThe MTN Mobile Money (MoMo) app has significantly expanded its international remittances capabilities by launching 25 additional wallet corridors in 10 new countries. With this extension, MoMo users can now send money to more than 200 million wallets, maintained by 39 partners, across 24 African countries.\n\nThe expansion benefits migrant populations in South Africa who send money home to Mozambique, Malawi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania are among the other countries where passageways have recently been opened. This is in addition to existing corridors including Zambia, Ghana, Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Congo Brazzaville, Benin, Guinea Conakry, and Guinea Bissau.\n\nMTN SA's general manager for Fintech Products and Services stated: \"With the addition of these new wallet corridors, we are furthering our commitment to facilitating seamless cross-border money transfers at a launch fee of 4%, which is lower than most competitors.\" All transactions made via the MTN MoMo app reflect instantly in the recipient's wallet. With a 4% sending fee, the service offers one of the most cost-effective solutions for cross-border remittances.\n\nThese services are delivered in partnership with MFS Africa and Saana Capital LLC.\n\nAccording to McKinsey's research, international remittances via mobile-money wallets grew by 65% year on year in 2020 to around $1 billion, with no signs of slowing.\n\nOnly Tier 2 and 3 MoMo wallet customers can access this service, due to BVN/KYC being a requirement for inbound remittances. However, Tier 1 customers with Verified NINs can also receive. MoMo enables users to store, send, and receive money using their phone. No bank account is needed, and the service works on every type of cellphone, including 3G feature phones.\n\n---\n\n## DOCUMENT 17: GSMA MOBILE MONEY REMITTANCES AFRICA 2024\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.gsma.com/sotir/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-State-of-the-Industry-Report-2025_English.pdf\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Mobile Money Statistics\n**REGION:** Africa\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CONTENT:**\nThe global value of mobile money transactions reached $1.68 trillion, up 16% year-on-year. Cross-border remittances reached $34 billion globally in 2024.\n\nAfrica continued to dominate the global mobile money market in 2024, with mobile money services on the continent handling $1.105 trillion last year — a 15% increase compared to 2023. Africa processed 65% of global mobile money transaction value last year, or $1.1 trillion. The continent also led in volume, accounting for nearly 82 billion of the 108 billion global transactions.\n\nIn 2024, Africans paid over $100 billion to merchants via mobile money, a 21% increase from the previous year. Additionally, $34 billion was processed in international remittances into Africa—a global sector in which the continent leads.\n\nA 2024 GSMA study found that the average cost of sending a cross-border mobile money remittance fell in 2024. With an average transfer fee of 3.54%, mobile money is the cheapest option for cross-border remittances. Despite this, mobile money makes up only 4% of global transfers.\n\nEast Africa remains the most active mobile money region with 459 million accounts and $649 billion in transactions in 2024. West Africa followed with 485 million accounts and $357 billion in transaction value, and Central Africa with 104 million accounts and $83 billion.\n\nNorth Africa and Southern Africa are still lagging behind, with only 25 million and 27 million accounts, respectively. Their transaction values—$10 billion and $6 billion—also remain far lower, partly due to higher banking penetration rates in these regions.\n\nAccording to the GSMA report, mobile money has added $190 billion to Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP, which has grown by $40 billion in just one year. In countries like Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, mobile money contributes between 5% and 8% of GDP.\n\nAfrica is home to more than half of all mobile money accounts globally. By the end of 2024, the continent had 1.1 billion registered accounts, representing 53% of the world total of 2.1 billion.\n\nTransaction costs of remittances to African countries remain higher than any other region, and it is almost certain that the UN SDG of reducing them below 3% by 2030 will be missed. According to Remitscope, the average cost of remissions to Africa was 8.4% in Q1 2024.\n\n---\n\n## DOCUMENT 18: HAWALA INFORMAL REMITTANCE SYSTEMS AFRICA\n\n**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/reports/Role-of-hawala-and-similar-in-ml-tf.pdf\n**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03\n**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Informal Channels\n**REGION:** Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Pan-African\n**CERTAINTY:** High\n\n**CONTENT:**\nHawala (Arabic: حِوالة ḥawāla, meaning transfer or sometimes trust), also known as xawala or xawilaad in Somali, is a popular and informal value transfer system based on the performance and honour of a huge network of money brokers (known as hawaladars). They operate outside of, or parallel to, traditional banking, financial channels and remittance systems. The system requires a minimum of two hawaladars that take care of the \"transaction\" without the movement of cash or telegraphic transfer.\n"
