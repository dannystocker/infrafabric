Modernising your core banking system isn’t one-size-fits-all. There are multiple viable paths forward, each with its own trade-offs in terms of speed, risk, internal capacity, and long-term value. This matrix will enable you to evaluate which pathway fits your institution best, based on your readiness, strategic goals, and internal capability. 2 December 2025 90-day sprint planning template Are you ready to build true momentum by planning your first modernisation sprint?

This planning template helps structure your first sprint with realistic actions, achievable outcomes, and clear accountability. Whether you’re kicking off internal discussions or working with an external partner, this format keeps you grounded in execution. 2 December 2025 Core modernisation checklist Is your institution ready to modernise its core banking system? If so, you’re making the right choice. Modernising your core banking platform is a strategic move that shapes your ability to grow, innovate, and compete. This checklist is designed to help your leadership, IT, and operations teams assess readiness across four key dimensions: technology, team capability, compliance and operations, and commercial alignment. Use this to identify where you’re strong, where you need to build, and what’s holding you back.
