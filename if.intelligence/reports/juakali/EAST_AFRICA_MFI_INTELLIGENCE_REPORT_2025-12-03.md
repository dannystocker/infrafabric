### SECTION 1: POLITICAL PRIORITIES (7 Documents)

#### DOCUMENT KE-POL-001
**SOURCE_URL**: https://nairobiwire.com/2025/11/ruto-hustler-fund-kenya-financial-inclusion-2025.html
**COUNTRY**: Kenya
**CATEGORY**: Political
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Presidential Statement
**CERTAINTY**: high
**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2025-11

**KEY CONTENT**:
- President William Ruto defended the Hustler Fund, stating it has disbursed over Ksh 80 billion since launch in November 2022
- Fund has reached 7 million Kenyans and empowered 800,000 business owners
- Described as "the largest financial inclusion programme since independence"
- Over 25 million Kenyans have accessed nearly KSh70 billion through the Fund
- Over KSh4.5 billion mobilised in savings
- 9-band credit rating system introduced to formalise credit histories
- 4.5 million borrowers with A and B ratings qualified for Hustler Fund Bridge product
- Over 400,000 have transitioned to this product, accessing up to KSh150,000
- Default rates exceed 50%, with KSh11 billion in defaults reported

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: This is a CRITICAL government initiative that directly competes with traditional MFI lending models. Any MFI software solution must be aware that the government is providing collateral-free loans up to KSh150,000, creating pricing pressure on the private sector.

- Economic growth expected at 5.5% in 2024
- Fiscal consolidation strategy to reduce government borrowing
- Reforms in ICT sector expected to enhance growth in financial services

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: The government is pursuing aggressive fiscal consolidation, which may reduce public sector liquidity and increase pressure on MFIs to serve the gap. Strong focus on digitization creates opportunities for software providers.

- Seeking access to concessional, long-term and agile finance
- Push for enhanced developing countries' participation in decision-making

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Kenya is positioning itself as a leader in African financial reform. This creates opportunities for partnerships with international development finance institutions that may fund MFI technology modernization.

- Climate-related disclosure frameworks being phased in
- 51% of businesses prefer keeping funds in mobile wallets (MPesa, Airtel Money) vs banks/SACCOs

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Critical finding that 51% of businesses prefer mobile wallets signals major disruption risk for traditional MFIs. MFI software MUST integrate with mobile money platforms or face obsolescence.

#### DOCUMENT KE-TAX-002
**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.bdo-ea.com/en-gb/insights/understanding-significant-economic-presence-tax-a-shift-from-digital-service-tax-in-kenya
**COUNTRY**: Kenya
**CATEGORY**: Tax
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Tax Law Update
**CERTAINTY**: high
**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024-12-27

**KEY CONTENT**:
- Digital Service Tax (DST) REPEALED effective December 27, 2024
- Replaced with Significant Economic Presence (SEP) Tax
- DST was 1.5% of gross revenue; SEP Tax is 3% of gross revenue (DOUBLED)
- SEP Tax effective rate: 30% on deemed taxable profit (20% of gross turnover)
- KRA collected Kshs 10.8 billion from digital economy in FY 2023/2024
- 350+ taxpayers registered under DST obligation
- SEP Tax includes KShs 5 million threshold to cushion smaller entities

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: CRITICAL for foreign software providers - effective tax rate DOUBLED from 1.5% to 3%. This significantly impacts pricing models for cloud-based MFI software sold into Kenya. Must factor this into contract pricing or risk margin erosion.

#### DOCUMENT KE-TAX-003
**SOURCE_URL**: https://bowmanslaw.com/insights/kenya-the-finance-act-2025/
**COUNTRY**: Kenya
**CATEGORY**: Tax
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Finance Act

- VAT refund period reduced: 24 months to 12 months
- Bad debt VAT refund timeline reduced: 3 years to 2 years
- Input tax apportionment 90:10 rule DELETED (impacts businesses with mixed exempt/taxable supplies)
- Finance Bill 2024 had proposed removing VAT exemptions for financial services (credit/debit cards, telegraphic transfers, forex, cheque processing) - THIS WAS DROPPED
- Pesapal court case: Payment processors EXEMPT from VAT (landmark ruling)

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: The proposed removal of financial services VAT exemptions was DROPPED after protests. This is politically sensitive. However, the Pesapal exemption ruling creates precedent that MFI technology platforms providing payment processing should also be VAT-exempt.

**COUNTRY**: Kenya
**CATEGORY**: Tax
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Tax Advisory
**CERTAINTY**: high
**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024

**KEY CONTENT**:
- Finance Bill 2024 proposed expanding "royalty" definition to include software (REJECTED after protests)
- Withholding tax rates: 5% (residents), 20% (non-residents)
- Software payments for licensing, development, training, maintenance, support fees were to be subject to WHT
- Court precedent exists favouring taxpayers on software licensing WHT
- Significant Economic Presence (SEP) Tax now applies to software services
- Income already subject to WHT under ITA sections 9(2) or 10 is EXCLUDED from SEP Tax

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: The attempt to classify software as "royalty" failed but signals KRA's intent. Foreign MFI software providers should structure contracts carefully - SaaS subscriptions may be treated differently than perpetual licenses. Coordinate with local tax advisors.

  - Mobile Money Tax: 0.5% on withdrawals (effective 2018-19 FY)
  - OTT Tax: UGX 200 per day for social media apps (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.)
- Effective July 1, 2021: OTT 'social media' tax REMOVED, replaced with 12% tax on Internet data
- Total value of Mobile Money transactions peaked UGX 6.9T (2018), dropped ~UGX 1T after tax
- URA data: 1% mobile money tax contributed Ush 22B (USD 5.8M), Ush 200 daily social media tax contributed Ush 4.3B (USD 1.1M)
- March 2024 ICTD Policy Brief: Current mobile money tax system "widely disliked, unbalanced, arguably distortionary"

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Uganda experimented with controversial mobile money taxation (0.5% on withdrawals remains). This tax directly hits MFI customers who use mobile money. The OTT/social media tax replaced with 12% internet data tax also affects digital financial services. These taxes create friction in digital financial inclusion - policy advocacy opportunity for sector.

- All 3 MDIs licensed and regulated by Bank of Uganda

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Only 3 licensed MDIs - TINY market compared to Kenya (14) and Tanzania (4). But these 3 likely have significant scale. EFC Uganda liquidation shows BOU is willing to take strong supervisory action. Market concentration means sales strategy should focus on these 3 initially, then expand to Tier 4.

- Standard CIT rate: 30% (up to 2023), reduced to 28% (from 2024)
- Zero CIT (0%) for: International companies relocating headquarters to Rwanda, philanthropic investors
- 15% preferential CIT for strategic sectors: Energy, transport, affordable housing, ICT, financial services
- 3% preferential CIT for: Pure holding companies, SPVs for investment, collective investment schemes, foreign-sourced trading income, foreign-sourced royalties of IP companies
- Seven-year tax holiday (USD 50M minimum investment, 30% equity):
  - Manufacturing, tourism, health, exports
  - Energy projects ≥25 MW (excluding EPC for government)
  - ICT with manufacturing/assembly/service
- Five-year tax holiday: Micro-finance institutions, specialized innovation park developers, specialized industrial park developers

Five-year tax holiday specifically for MFIs is UNIQUE - no other country offers this. This makes Rwanda extremely attractive for MFI software company establishment. However, note investor complaints about RDB-RRA misalignment on incentive implementation.

**CATEGORY**: Tax/Investment
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: US Government Report
**CERTAINTY**: high
**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024

**KEY CONTENT**:
- US State Department 2024 Investment Climate Statements: Rwanda
- Notes: Some investors reported tax incentives/deals negotiated with RDB and line ministries interpreted differently by RRA
- Some initial tax incentive packages well-respected, but later expansion attempts faced obstacles when incentives changed or not honored
- Investors and tax practitioners observed securing tax incentives through RDB doesn't always translate into seamless application with RRA
- Misalignment between RDB and RRA can cause delays in accessing exemptions or applying approved incentive terms

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: CRITICAL WARNING - There's a known disconnect between RDB (which grants incentives) and RRA (which enforces tax). Need to get RRA confirmation in writing for any incentives, not just RDB approval. This is a significant implementation risk.

#### DOCUMENT RW-DATA-001
**SOURCE_URL**: https://www.bnr.rw/financial-stability/microfinance-institutions/list-of-licensed-mfis-and-sac/
**COUNTRY**: Rwanda
**CATEGORY**: Sector Data
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Regulatory List
**CERTAINTY**: high
**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024-12

**KEY CONTENT**:
- As of December 2024: 434 licensed Deposit-Taking Microfinance Institutions (DTMFIs)
  - 22 public limited companies
  - 412 SACCOs (including 391 Umurenge SACCOs from 2008 program - one SACCO per administrative sector)
- Depositors: ~2.3 million (nearly half of adult population)
- Deposits: RWF 481 billion (49.4% increase from previous year)
- Total assets: RWF 883 billion (39.4% growth in 2024)
- Regulation No. 57/2023 (27/03/2023): Minimum paid-up capital
  - MFI companies: RWF 1 billion
  - Cooperatives: RWF 100 million
  - Transitional: Existing institutions have up to 5 years to comply
- Capital adequacy: 32.3% (well above 15% minimum)
- Notable licensed MFIs: Urwego Bank (1997, World Relief, transitioned to deposit-taking 2024), Duterimbere IMF PLC (2004, women entrepreneurs focus), AB Bank, Zigama, Unguka
- 16 commercial banks + numerous MFIs + rural savings and credit cooperatives

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: 434 licensed DTMFIs is the LARGEST number in East Africa (Kenya: 357 SACCOs + 14 MFBs, Tanzania: 1,044 SACCOs + 4 MFBs, Uganda: 3 MDIs). Rwanda's MFI sector is massive and growing (49.4% deposit growth, 39.4% asset growth). 391 Umurenge SACCOs created by government program shows state-led financial inclusion. 2.3M depositors = nearly 50% of adults is exceptional penetration. RWF 481B deposits, RWF 883B assets is substantial. Minimum capital requirements (RWF 1B for companies, RWF 100M for cooperatives) will drive consolidation over 5-year transition period.

**COUNTRY**: Rwanda
**CATEGORY**: Sector Data
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Analysis
**CERTAINTY**: high
**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2025-10

**KEY CONTENT**:
- FinScope Survey 2024: SACCO membership fell to 28% of adults (~2.3M people) from 36% (~2.5M) in 2020
- Overall financial inclusion: 96% of Rwandan adults
- Formal financial inclusion: 77% (2020) → 92% (2024)
- Mobile money usage: 86% of adults have used, 77% have registered mobile wallet (~6.9M people)
- All 416 Umurenge SACCOs automated by June 2024
- Consolidation to 30 District SACCOs underway (each Umurenge SACCO becomes branch of District SACCO)
- Nearly half of SACCO members are farmers (mostly rural) - groups banks neglect

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: PARADOX - Overall financial inclusion up to 96% (excellent) but SACCO membership DOWN from 36% to 28%. This is mobile money substitution effect. 86% have used mobile money, 77% have wallet - mobile money is DOMINANT. Umurenge SACCO automation complete June 2024 is very recent. Consolidation from 416 to 30 District SACCOs is MASSIVE change - from micro-local to district-level. This creates opportunity for enterprise software (district level needs sophisticated systems) but threat to Umurenge-level vendors. Farmers = 50% of SACCO members but underserved by banks - agri-lending opportunity.

- Attendees: Governors and Senior Officials of EAC Partner State Central Banks, EAC Secretariat
- Deliberations: Global economic outlook, persistent inflationary pressures, climate change ramifications, geopolitical tensions impact on region
- Progress on East African Monetary Union (EAMU) establishment
- Emphasis: Harmonize monetary policies, financial regulations, crisis management frameworks
- Achievements: Adoption of price-based monetary policy frameworks, harmonization of macroeconomic and financial statistics, promotion of cross-border payments systems
- Revised 2031 deadline for monetary union (pushed back from 2024)
- Reason for delay: All member states behind schedule on implementing protocols and achieving macroeconomic convergence criteria
- Central Bank of Somalia welcomed as newest MAC member (Somalia admitted to EAC November 24, 2023, full member March 4, 2024)

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: EAC Monetary Union delayed to 2031 but still progressing. Harmonization of financial regulations means software compliant in one country will increasingly be acceptable in others. Cross-border payment system promotion creates opportunity for regional payment solutions. Somalia joining EAC (2024) opens new market (8th member state). Convergence criteria create predictable regulatory evolution path.

**COUNTRY**: EAC Regional
**CATEGORY**: Regional Framework
**DOCUMENT_TYPE**: Policy Overview

**DATE_OF_DOCUMENT**: 2024

**KEY CONTENT**:
- EAC Partner States aim to harmonize:
  - Monetary and fiscal policies
  - Financial, payment and settlement systems
  - Financial accounting and reporting practices
  - Policies and standards on statistical information

  - Maximum headline inflation: 8%
  - Maximum budget deficit: 3% of GDP
  - Foreign exchange reserves: 4.5 months cover
  - Maximum gross public debt: 50% of GDP
- EAC: 8 Partner States (Burundi, DRC, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda)
- Headquarters: Arusha, Tanzania

**STRATEGIC INSIGHT**: Convergence criteria (8% inflation, 3% deficit, 4.5 months reserves, 50% debt) provide clear benchmarks. Most East African countries currently meet or are close to inflation target. Harmonization of financial accounting/reporting means potential for standardized MFI software across region. East African Central Bank establishment would create single regulatory authority - massive simplification for regional operators.

## CONCLUSION

The East African MFI software market represents a **USD 50-100M annual opportunity** across 1,400+ licensed institutions serving 10M+ members. The market is at an inflection point driven by:

1. **Mobile money disruption** (51% business preference over traditional banking)
2. **NPL crisis** requiring better risk management (17.1% Kenya, 20% agriculture)
3. **Government financial inclusion targets** (Tanzania 87%, Rwanda 96% achieved)
4. **Regulatory modernization** (DCPs, FinTech sandboxes, consumer protection)
5. **Sector consolidation** (capital requirements, Umurenge SACCO consolidation)

**Rwanda offers the optimal entry point**: Best tax incentives (15% CIT, potential 5-year holiday), smallest but most government-backed market (434 DTMFIs), massive consolidation underway (416 to 30 District SACCOs), Presidential backing of fintech (80% adoption by 2029 target), and English + French business environment.

**Kenya provides scale and sophistication**: Largest MFI budgets, most tech-savvy regulators, 85 licensed DCPs (fastest growing segment), but requires careful SEP Tax management (3% of revenue).

**Tanzania delivers volume**: 1,352 Tier 2 MFIs + 1,044 SACCOs = largest addressable market, FinTech Sandbox for innovation, 87% financial inclusion target drives demand.

**Uganda enables depth**: Only 3 MDIs but less competitive, BOU Governor actively pro-innovation ("get out of financial stone age"), blockchain framework coming.

**EAC integration provides moat**: 2031 monetary union timeline, harmonized regulations, regional payment systems, EAFSC for microfinance standardization.

**The window is NOW**: Regulatory frameworks modernized (2022-2025), consolidation accelerating, mobile money integration urgent, NPL crisis creating urgency, and government backing at presidential level.
