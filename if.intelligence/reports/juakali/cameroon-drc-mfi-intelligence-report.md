IMF Report on Observance of Standards and Codes: Cameroon Banking Supervision

COBAC's Role:
National and supranational watchdog for finance within CEMAC. Undertakes establishment of prudential ratios and management of crises in financial institutions.

Master Framework:
Standard n° 01/02/CEMAC/IMAC/COBAC (2002) - Organization and supervising MFIs activities in CEMAC.

Liquidity and Solvency:
- Largest MFIs exposed to credit risk
- Would not comply with solvency ratio following 15% transition of performing loans to NPLs
- Drop of up to 30% in deposit base would not threaten liquidity ratio compliance

Basel Alignment:
Only 69% of banks would comply with solvency ratio once risk weights recalibrated to ensure better alignment of CEMAC rules with Basel.

Regulatory Gaps:
- Prudential regulations less stringent than international standards
- Regional regulatory framework for microfinance (designed decade ago) needs strengthening
- Shortage of human resources for supervision
- Weaknesses of governance, transparency, capacity, and information systems persist

Recommendation:
Large MFIs should be subject to enhanced supervisory framework, closer to banks.

Liquidity Requirements:
Regulations should propose clearer methodology for calculating banks' liquidity ratios. Minimum liquidity requirements should be communicated to regulators.

Central Bank Policy Rate:
BCC maintained 25% policy rate since 2023—highest in sub-Saharan Africa—to curb inflation and stabilize CDF.

DRC is dollarized economy. Most institutions accept U.S. dollars or Congolese francs.

New Governor (2025):
André Wameso stated restoring credibility of Congolese franc and rolling back decades of dollarization will define his term. Argued monetary sovereignty impossible when households, firms, government treat dollar as default unit of account, store of value, medium of exchange.
