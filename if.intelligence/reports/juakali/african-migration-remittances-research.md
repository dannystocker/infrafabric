## DOCUMENT 1: WORLD BANK KNOMAD AFRICA REMITTANCE FLOWS 2024-2025

**SOURCE_URL:** https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/099714008132436612/pdf/IDU1a9cf73b51fcad1425a1a0dd1cc8f2f3331ce.pdf

**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Global Overview
**REGION:** Global/Africa
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
KNOMAD (Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development) was active from 2013 until 2024, hosted by the World Bank and supported by the EU, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland. During its existence, KNOMAD produced 40 migration and development briefs, 61 working papers, and numerous other policy briefs, many focused on remittance flows, trends, and challenges.

After a period of strong growth during 2021-2022, officially recorded remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) moderated in 2023, reaching an estimated $656 billion. The modest 0.7% growth rate reflects large variances in regional growth, but remittances remained a crucial source of external finance for developing countries in 2023. Looking ahead, remittances to LMICs are expected to grow at a faster rate of 2.3% in 2024.

Sub-Saharan Africa continued to have the highest average remittance costs in Q4 2023, at about 7.9 per cent; East Asia and Pacific and South Asia had the lowest average remittance costs at 5.8 per cent.

The World Bank's Migration and Development Brief 40 (June 2024) includes detailed data on resource flows to Sub-Saharan Africa and the costs of sending remittances to African countries, which vary widely across corridors.

## DOCUMENT 2: SOUTH AFRICA TO SADC REMITTANCES MARKET ASSESSMENT 2024

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.resbank.co.za/content/dam/sarb/what-we-do/payments-and-settlements/cross-border-payments-conference/documents/paper-sa-sadc.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Corridors/Intra-African
**REGION:** Southern Africa (South Africa-SADC)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The South Africa to Zimbabwe corridor has emerged as the largest inbound remittance route in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, with an average of over 3 million transactions and USD 296 million annually between 2016 and 2021.

Zimbabweans are the largest SADC migrants in South Africa, accounting for almost 50 percent of migrants (1.7 million of a total of 3.4 million SADC migrants) from the SADC region. According to IOM data from July 2024, the corridor recorded 32,309 movements, constituting 92% of all migration flows across Zimbabwe's official border points.

The South African corridor accounts for the highest level of remittances to Zimbabwe, with 43 percent in 2021, up from 38 percent in 2015. Zimbabwean migrants record the highest share of those remitting, at 59%, which stands noticeably above the SADC average of 56%. Approximately 49% of Zimbabweans send funds once a month.

Mozambique is ranked one of the top five countries that supply migrant labour to South Africa. According to the World Bank, Mozambique has enjoyed a steady increase in its remittances received from $93,372,690 in 2016 to $453,972,066 in 2021. As a percentage of GDP, remittance flow increased from 0.8% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2021 and dropped to 1.6% in 2022.

Almost half of SADC migrants are estimated to be Zimbabwean, with the next largest migrant populations coming from Malawi, Mozambique and Lesotho. Malawi and Mozambique have experienced a decline in formal remittance volumes in recent years. Malawian remittances in 2024 were 49% lower than their 2021 high, while Mozambican remittances have decreased by 36% since their high point in 2022. Malawi's decline in formal remittances is mostly driven by the country's currency crisis, creating discrepancies between official and black market exchange rates that steer remitters towards informal channels.

The estimated informal market size is around R3.4 billion, or around 17% of the size of the formal market. This is likely a substantial underestimate of the true size of the informal market. Discussions highlighted the use of 'grey' remittance channels that blend formal infrastructure with informal practices, particularly within the Mozambican corridor.

## DOCUMENT 3: BURKINA FASO - CÔTE D'IVOIRE MIGRATION CORRIDOR

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.mideq.org/en/migration-corridors/burkina-faso-cote-divoire/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Corridors/Seasonal Migration
**REGION:** West Africa (Burkina Faso-Côte d'Ivoire)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Hosting 2.1 million intra-African migrants in 2017, with an annual immigration growth rate of between 1.8% and 4.4%, Côte d'Ivoire is the second most important destination for international migrants on the African continent after South Africa.

In 2017, a total of 1.3 million migrants used the corridors between Côte d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso, making it the second most important migration corridor in Africa and the number one destination for migrants within the West African region. In 2023, the Burkina Faso to Côte d'Ivoire migration corridor had the largest stock of migrants, namely 1,376,350, followed by Mali with 522,146 migrants.

Under French colonization and the Colonial Development Act of 1921, Burkina Faso became a main labor source for agricultural and factory work in Côte d'Ivoire. Conventions on migration were signed with Côte d'Ivoire (March 9, 1960), Mali (September 30, 1969), and Gabon (August 13, 1973) to provide security for Burkinabè migrants and to organize their remittances.

Every year, thousands of seasonal workers from West and Central Africa travel to gold mining areas in Burkina Faso, Senegal, or Mali. Nearly 90% of Burkinabè justify their migration to Côte d'Ivoire by the search for paid work and to help their families back home. Migration was part of a strategy to improve their social status and that of their entourage.

According to the BCEAO, in 2011, Burkina Faso received 96.5 billion CFA francs in remittances from migrants, 31% of which came from Côte d'Ivoire. According to data from a 2018 survey, these remittances amounted to 81 billion CFA francs, 45% of which came from Côte d'Ivoire. In the 1990s, remittances made up about six percent of Burkina's GDP. Although one third of households in Burkina Faso receive remittances, it remains one of the world's poorest countries.

IOM data indicates regional migration dropped by nearly 50 per cent during the first half of 2020 compared with 2019 due to government travel restrictions and COVID-19 impacts.

## DOCUMENT 4: NIGERIA MIGRATION CORRIDORS AND REMITTANCE FLOWS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.un.org/osaa/sites/www.un.org.osaa/files/files/documents/2024/publications/23343_un_policypaper_remittanceswestafrica_v04.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Major Recipient
**REGION:** West Africa (Nigeria)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Nigeria deals with a range of migration issues, from massive internal and regional migration to brain drain and a large, well-educated diaspora in the West. The top destination countries for Nigerian emigrants include the United States, the United Kingdom, Ghana, Chad, Cameroon, Italy, Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Spain, Sudan, and Niger.

Many forcibly displaced Nigerians (approximately 333,411) are forced to become refugees in neighboring Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. As of October 2022, there were a total of 345,500 Nigerian refugees in Niger (187,136), Cameroon (138,107), and Chad (20,257). This displacement occurred after Boko Haram extended its insurgency to neighboring countries of the Lake Chad Basin.

Remittance flows in 2022 in West Africa demonstrated a significant pattern and resilience, with Nigeria being the primary recipient of almost $21 billion, accounting for over 60 per cent of the subregion's inflows. Remittances to Nigeria, accounting for around 38% of total remittance inflows to the region, increased by 3.3% to $20.1 billion. In 2024, the Nigerian diaspora, concentrated primarily in the United States and United Kingdom, sent $19.8 billion back.

Remittances originating from Africa to Nigeria account for 12.7% of total inflows, with the top six originating countries being Cameroon (23.4%), Ghana (17.2%), Togo (16.8%), South Africa (13.3%), Benin (8.6%) and Niger (5.6%).

The increase in remittance flows to the region supported the current accounts of several African countries dealing with food insecurity, supply chain disruptions, severe drought (Horn of Africa), floods (in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Cameroon), and debt-servicing difficulties.

## DOCUMENT 5: KENYA-TANZANIA EAST AFRICA MOBILE MONEY CORRIDOR

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.fsdkenya.org/blogs-publications/informal-remittance-is-still-common-in-east-africa-and-is-moving-with-the-times/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Mobile Money
**REGION:** East Africa (Kenya-Tanzania)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
East Africa leads the continent in mobile money adoption, with over 60% of remittance transactions conducted digitally. In 2023, East Africa processed over 2 billion mobile money transactions monthly, with Kenya and Tanzania leading. Kenya's M-Pesa pioneers this with 96% of Kenyan households using mobile money. Kenya achieved the top remittance index score (97), nearby Rwanda (92), and the United Republic of Tanzania (90) also attaining high scores.

The cost of diaspora remittances from Tanzania to Kenya and Uganda was among the highest in Africa in the past year, averaging between 17 percent and 21 percent per $200. However, between Kenya and Tanzania, Ecobank charges 28.43 percent while the M-Pesa charge is only 5.86 percent (and Western Union only 4.14 percent).

In 2022, FSD Kenya commissioned research to explore the use of informal channels for remittances and low-value trade payments sent by MSMEs between Kenya and Tanzania (back-and-forth) and Kenya and Uganda. The main finding was that the preferred method of nearly 70% of senders was through formal channels, with the most popular channel being services offered by mobile money operators (e.g., sending money from Safaricom M-PESA to MTN in Uganda).

Research revealed a widespread practice of informal channels using digital means, where customers go to unregistered/unlicenced mobile money "agents" who provide cross-border money transfer services.

Thunes announced a new service corridor for users of M-Pesa Tanzania, enabling Tanzanians to seamlessly move money from their M-Pesa mobile wallets directly to any bank account in Kenya and Rwanda. A partnership between Access Holdings, Coronation Group, Safaricom, and M-PESA Africa will initially focus on pivotal markets including Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, and Tanzania, with the goal of connecting more than 60 million customers and 5 million businesses across 8 countries.

The region's mobile money accounts grew from 160 million in 2018 to 300 million by 2023.

## DOCUMENT 6: DRC-ZAMBIA MINING CORRIDOR

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/drc-mining-industry-child-labor-and-formalization-small-scale-mining
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Corridors/Mining Labor
**REGION:** Central-Southern Africa (DRC-Zambia)
**CERTAINTY:** Medium

**CONTENT:**
The cobalt is often extracted from Artisanal and Small-scale mines (ASM) in the South-Eastern parts of the DRC, part of the mineral dense Copper Belt stretching across parts of DRC and Zambia. The Katanga copperbelt in the DRC is a belt about 70 kilometres wide and 250 kilometres long between Lubumbashi and Kolwezi. Together, the DRC and Zambian copper belts are the second largest global reserve of copper, about 1/3 the size of the Chilean reserve.

More than half of the world's cobalt resources are located in the DRC, and over 70% of the world's cobalt mining occurs there. Artisanal miners produce 20% of the country's cobalt output. The World Bank estimates that about 10 million people depend directly or indirectly on artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) in sub-Saharan Africa.

Of the 255,000 Congolese mining for cobalt, 40,000 are children, some as young as six years. Much of the work is informal small-scale mining in which laborers earn less than $2 per day.

Cross-border synergies enable mining companies to optimize container utilization by consolidating Zambian copper with DRC cobalt shipments. This operational efficiency reduces per-tonne transportation costs and improves competitiveness in international markets. There are six toll booths along the 400 km strategic route from Kolwezi, a major mining town, to Kasumbalesa on the border with Zambia.

Zambia maintains its position as Africa's second-largest copper producer, contributing approximately 3-4% of global copper output. The country's mining sector generates 70-75% of national export revenue. Most of this mining takes place in the Copperbelt, a large region covering much of the southern DRC and extending into northern Zambia. In this region, entire communities are often exposed to dangerous working conditions, toxic pollution and violence.

## DOCUMENT 7: WEST AFRICA GULF OF GUINEA FISHING COMMUNITIES MIGRATION

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.fao.org/4/i0448e/i0448e03.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Seasonal/Fishing Communities
**REGION:** West Africa (Gulf of Guinea)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Seasonal or rural-rural migration are the main forms of migration exhibited by small-scale fishers in Ghana. Fisher migration is the movement of fishers to fishing grounds (or camps) away from home for any period ranging from few weeks to several months, mostly on a temporary basis and occasionally permanently. Most marine fishers do not limit their work to a single fishing community due to seasonal fish movements, tidal patterns, and economic opportunities.

Adverse fishing water condition propels fishermen to migrate to countries with better fishing opportunities in the region. This is evident in the declining and seasonality of fisheries resources due to climate change and upsurge along the hotspots on West African coast, displacing fishing folks mainly from Ghana to Côte d'Ivoire and Nigeria. The migration lasts sometimes for up to 6 months.

The main cause of fishermen migrating from other West African countries to Nigeria is due to seasonal migration of commercial fish species and some of the migrants have permanently settled in the fishing communities.

Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, and Nigeria are documented and perceived to have had major fisheries-driven human migrations in the sub-region. For a long time and up until the early 1980s, fishers used to migrate to the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Guinea to fish during the dry season (January-June) and return to Senegal for the rainy season to work in the fields.

Fishers based in Libreville moved seasonally (July–August–September) towards the northern part of the coast to fish bonga (Ethmalosa fimbriata). These seasonal movements were generally motivated by a wish to avoid management regulations according to which the bonga fishery around Libreville was closed during this period.

Male fishers in Ghana's small-scale fisheries sector typically move between fishing communities to perform offshore fishing activities. In contrast, women often perform near-shore fishing activities, engaging in fish processing, financing fishing expeditions, and managing trade networks. Fisheries driven migration is male-dominated and it has a clear gender-labour division in the sub-region.

Migrant fishers are known to impact the economic status of the host communities through the provision of jobs to the youths as well as sharing their catch with the locals. However, migrant fishers sometimes engage in confrontations with the locals of the host communities with varying degrees of violence.

## DOCUMENT 8: FULANI AND MAASAI PASTORAL COMMUNITIES SEASONAL MIGRATION

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.jstor.org/stable/2843971
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Seasonal/Pastoral Communities
**REGION:** West Africa (Fulani), East Africa (Maasai)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The Fulani people of West Africa demonstrate horizontal transhumance, moving their cattle herds between dry season grazing areas near water sources and wet season pastures in areas that become inaccessible during rains. Pastoralists' cattle in the past could graze freely on vast and safe rangelands. During the wet season, pastoralists returned to the northern savannah (Sudan savannah and semi-arid zone) to avoid the risk of tsetse-transmitted African animal trypanosomiasis.

The symbiotic relationship between farmers and herders in the post-harvest period consisted of cattle benefitting from crop residues in harvested fields and farmers deriving manure from dung deposited on their fields. Among Fulani in northern Burkina Faso, there are no 'pure agriculturalists' as everyone has at least some sheep or goats. However, those involved primarily in agricultural production are much more likely to leave than are pastoralists or agro-pastoralists.

The Maasai originated from the Nile Valley region and migrated southward over centuries, settling in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya and Tanzania. Their migration followed key ecological corridors that ensured access to water and pasture for their cattle. These ancient routes enabled the Maasai to avoid prolonged drought conditions by moving seasonally.

Maasai pastoralists face numerous constraints that compel them to diversify their livelihoods and, at times, migrate without their livestock. A 2023 study of young Maasai men in the Amboseli region gathered information from 162 individuals who collectively undertook 445 migrations. The analysis revealed key geographic hubs (e.g., Nairobi region and coastal areas) and three distinct forms: (i) one-way migrations, (ii) direct return trips, and (iii) circular migration patterns.

Although less frequent, remittances directed toward agricultural investment further underscore the growing role of farming in Maasai livelihoods. Notably, some migrants have used remittances to secure land titles, thereby linking migration with the broader struggle to maintain access to critical pastoral resources.

Studies show that migration often aims to increase livestock holdings. The high proportion of migrants sending money for the purchase of animals, veterinary products, and the hiring of herders underscores their continued attachment to both the land they left and to livestock-based livelihoods. Migration in Maasai communities is becoming a cultural norm and not only a response to economic conditions.

Migration both positively and negatively influenced households' resilience. Remittances from migrants enhanced households' economic capital (notably livestock and agriculture), cultural capital such as food and health support, various household equipment and the improvement of formal education and skills.

## DOCUMENT 9: AGRICULTURAL SEASONAL MIGRATION AFRICA

**SOURCE_URL:** https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-025-10716-1
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Seasonal/Agricultural Labor
**REGION:** Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Migration in Africa is mostly intra-regional; a primarily cross-border seasonal movement of laborers from contiguous areas during harvest time. Intra-African migration mainly happens for economic reasons, with people mostly moving in search of work in the informal sector. Both long-term and seasonal labour migrants regularly moved from landlocked countries in the Sahel to the coastal zones in Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire and Senegal that were home to significant cash crop production.

The Ethiopia-Sudan borderlands have long been a hub of capitalist production of lucrative agricultural commodities such as sesame that profoundly shape the political economy of these borderlands. Cross-border seasonal migrant labour is central to this capitalist commodity production.

Seasonal migrant labourers often move between commercial farms, with a considerable number also moving to Sudan seeking work on commercial farms, especially in the neighbouring Gedaref state, where they mainly engage in weeding and harvesting sesame, cotton and sorghum. They migrate to Metema and Humera in April-July, returning to their villages in September. They leave again in November for the harvesting season, returning to their villages between January and February.

Even if labor migration from rural to urban areas causes a labor shortage during peak seasons, remittances assist migrant-sending households in alleviating credit constraints in agricultural production, allowing the migrant-sending households to purchase agricultural inputs and absorb any risk eventualities in production.

Remittances are mostly used for consumption, such as food and clothing, as well as to purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, livestock, hired labor, and rent land. While remittances contribute to improved household incomes, education, and healthcare, migration also leads to demographic shifts, labour shortages, dependency on external income, and disruptions to traditional social cohesion.

Western African countries received 27 billion USD in remittances in 2020. Nigeria, the largest recipient in Sub-Saharan Africa in absolute terms, received nearly 64 per cent of this total (17.2 billion), while the Gambia (15.6 per cent) and Cabo Verde (13.9 per cent) received the most remittances as a share of GDP.

Climate change has led to a 34-percent reduction in agricultural productivity growth in sub-Saharan Africa since 1961, which is further contributing to unprecedented food insecurity on the continent. Climate change is predicted to be the driver of up to 10 percent of all African cross-border migration by mid-century.

## DOCUMENT 10: AFRICA TO EUROPE MIGRATION CORRIDORS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/JRC123516/jrc123516_remittances_in_north_africa_04_02_2021_final.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Africa to Global/Diaspora
**REGION:** North Africa to Europe (France, UK, Italy)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The main migration corridors for North Africa include Egypt–Saudi Arabia, Algeria–France, Egypt–Jordan, Morocco–France, Morocco–Spain, Morocco–Italy, and Egypt–Libya. Since the 1960s, the main source countries of migration from Africa to Europe have been Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and to a lesser extent, Egypt. This has resulted in large diasporas with origins in these countries by the end of the 20th century.

Much of this migration was from the Maghreb to France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. From the second half of the 1980s, the destination countries for migrants from the Maghreb broadened to include Spain and Italy, as a result of increased demand for low-skilled labour in those countries.

The MAFE (Migration between Africa and Europe) project focused on migration flows between Europe, namely Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK) and Senegal, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) and Ghana, which together account for over a quarter of all African migration to the EU.

About half of African migrants in Europe are of North African origin, mostly residing in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands, while the other half are of Sub-Saharan African origin, present throughout Western Europe, with significant concentrations in Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom.

The Nigerian diaspora, concentrated primarily in the United States and United Kingdom, sent $19.8 billion back in 2024. Morocco rounded out the top three with $12 billion in inflows. Morocco, benefiting from its proximity to Europe, receives remittances primarily from France, Spain, and Italy, reflecting its strong diaspora presence in these countries.

Over 70% of Morocco's remittances came from EU countries, mainly France, Spain and Italy, although it also receives remittances from Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands. Moroccan external flows are highly reliant on international remittances from France, which provided 36% of Morocco's international remittances in 2019.

Several corridors from EU Member States, such as France to Algeria or Tunisia, and Italy to Morocco or Tunisia, have high costs despite large migrant stocks and a wide range of service providers.

Irregular migration from West and Central Africa often occurs along the central Mediterranean route (sea crossings from North African countries and the Middle East mainly to Italy); the western Mediterranean route (consisting of several subroutes linking Morocco and Algeria to Spain); and the west African Atlantic route (from West African coastal countries and Morocco to the Canary Islands in Spain).

Remittances are a lifeline sent by migrants to their families and communities back home. They lift the recipients out of poverty and pay for food, education and health care. The African diaspora should be seen as a potential resource rather than as a concern: a potential human and social capital that can make a major contribution to the political and institutional development of home countries of origin.

## DOCUMENT 11: AFRICA TO GULF STATES MIGRATION CORRIDORS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://comparativemigrationstudies.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40878-024-00390-3
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Africa to Global/Labor Migration
**REGION:** Sub-Saharan Africa to GCC (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
There is a surge in migration of workers from Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, and Bahrain. This is driven by GCC nations' efforts to diversify their economies beyond oil, while Sub-Saharan Africa faces a demographic explosion with many young people entering the job market.

In 2023, total remittance flows from the GCC to SSA reached $28.3 billion, with most outflows coming from Saudi Arabia ($12.5 billion), the UAE ($8.2 billion), and Qatar ($3.7 billion). The GCC countries are significant contributors to remittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa, with major recipients including Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda.

According to a Gulf Labor Markets and Migration factsheet, in Saudi Arabia, the 2022 census recorded 715,000 nationals from Sub-Saharan African countries, representing 5.3 percent of the Kingdom's total foreign population.

Unlike other nationality groups from Arab and Asian countries, Sub-Saharan African migrants in the GCC are mostly women, with Ethiopia as a key source of migrants, most notably to Saudi Arabia.

The top source of expatriates across the GCC countries is India. Out of the top ten migration corridors in the world, the India–UAE and India–Saudi Arabia corridors rank fourth and ninth. Other common source countries include Egypt (with the Egypt–Saudi Arabia migration corridor ranked tenth), Pakistan, Philippines, Jordan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.

In 2019, there were 35 million foreign workers in the Gulf region, corresponding to approximately 21 percent of global figures. The number of remittances sent by foreign workers in the Gulf region to their countries through official channels is around $100 billion, with Saudi Arabia and the UAE among the top three countries globally for remittance outflows.

Labor migration relative to total population averages around 50 percent across the GCC countries. The UAE and Qatar have led in hosting international labor migrants relative to their population, with Oman and Saudi Arabia maintaining a more measured approach.

Long-term and permanent residency schemes were launched in Qatar and the UAE in 2018. UAE Cabinet Resolution 56 of 2018 grants "golden visas" valid for five or ten years to investors, entrepreneurs, and specialized talents. Saudi Arabia in 2019 introduced the sponsor-free Premium Residency scheme, offering permanent legal residence for 800,000 riyals (approximately $213,000).

## DOCUMENT 12: AFRICA TO UNITED STATES DIASPORA REMITTANCES

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/sub-saharan-african-immigrants-united-states-2025
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Africa to Global/Diaspora
**REGION:** Africa to USA
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Approximately 2.5 million sub-Saharan African immigrants lived in the United States in 2024—more than triple the number in 2000—with most coming from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, or South Africa.

The Nigerian diaspora is the largest from the region, with close to 905,000 members, followed by the 412,000 U.S. residents who have links to Ethiopia and 332,000 with ties to Ghana. The United States has many African immigrants from Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, and Kenya. These groups are well-established and have strong ties to their home countries, which fuel the flow of remittances.

Migrants and other individuals worldwide sent approximately $54.3 billion in remittances via formal channels to sub-Saharan African countries in 2024, an 80 percent increase since 2010.

Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, fell to the #2 position (behind Egypt). The Nigerian diaspora, concentrated primarily in the United States and United Kingdom, continues to maintain strong ties to their homeland, sending $19.8 billion back in 2024. Although the largest total remittances to the region went to Nigeria ($19.8 billion), which is the second largest sub-Saharan African economy (after South Africa), these transfers accounted for 8 percent of its GDP.

The $7.2bn 2018 Nigerian Remittance in the United States of America is more than the entire $6.7bn allocated for 2019 capital spending.

RemitSCOPE compiles and shows remittance inflow and outflow data published by Central Banks, broken down at a corridor level. There are currently four countries in Africa that are publishing remittance data broken down by corridor; these are Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco and Senegal.

As of 2023, Africa received over $100 billion in remittances, amounting to approximately 6% of the continent's GDP. This surpassed both official development assistance ($42 billion) and foreign direct investment (FDI) ($48 billion), highlighting a seismic shift in the region's external financing dynamics.

In Nigeria, for example, these funds are critical for daily needs, education, and business ventures. Families rely on remittances to pay for schooling, healthcare, and housing, which helps to alleviate poverty and raise living standards.

Remittance prices fell from 9.8 per cent in Q2 2016 to 8.2 per cent in Q1 2025, a drop of 1.6 percentage points. At this rate of progress Africa will fail to meet SDG 10.c which states that remittance prices will not average more than 3 percent by 2030.

A substantial share of Africa's remittance flows continues to move through informal channels, such as hand-carried cash or unregistered transfer systems, particularly evident in the DR Congo, Libya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Nigeria.

## DOCUMENT 13: WORLD BANK REMITTANCE PRICES WORLDWIDE 2024

**SOURCE_URL:** https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q124_final.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Costs
**REGION:** Global/Africa Focus
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The transaction cost of remittances to African countries remains higher than any other region. According to Remitscope (which uses World Bank data), the average cost of remissions to Africa was 8.4 percent in the First Quarter of 2024.

Of the 6 corridors with costs above 20 percent in Q1 2024, three originate in Sub-Saharan Africa and four are destined for Sub-Saharan Africa. In Q1 2024, 25 of the 354 corridors did not have any SmaRT qualifying services. Of these 25 corridors, fourteen are destined for Sub-Saharan Africa.

In Q1 2024, South Africa (7.08 percent) is the most expensive country in the G20 group to remit to, followed by China (6.61 percent).

The marginal cost of sending USD200 from South Africa to Mozambique has decreased from 21.76 percent in Q3 2014 to 9.7 percent a decade later. The marginal cost of remittances from South Africa to Zimbabwe has decreased from 17.89 percent in Q3 2014 to 13.18 percent a decade later.

World Bank research shows that banks remain the most expensive service providers on African remittance corridors because banks tend to charge a flat fee which is usually a high percentage of the value of the remittance.

Although costs are coming down, they are doing so slowly and it is almost certain that the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (No. 10c) of reducing them to below three percent of the value remitted by 2030 will be missed.

In Q1 2024, the global average for digital remittances was recorded at 4.96 percent, while the global average for non-digital remittances was 6.94 percent.

## DOCUMENT 14: WESTERN UNION AND MONEYGRAM MARKET SHARE AFRICA

**SOURCE_URL:** https://blog.mondato.com/western-union-remittances-competition/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Providers/Traditional Operators
**REGION:** Africa/Global
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The undisputed legacy champion in the remittance field is Western Union, followed by a number of smaller but similar players like MoneyGram & RIA. Although Western Union continues to lead global payments, its market share has diminished due to increasing competition. Western Union continues to maintain its global presence handling just under 12 percent of flows.

MoneyGram stands out as a case study within this evolving marketplace. Once Western Union's main competitor, the company faced performance fluctuations amidst management changes. When the 2009 recession hit, MoneyGram was significantly impacted and lost market share—creating space for new competitors.

The South Africa Remittance & Cross-Border Transfers Market is characterized by a dynamic mix of regional and international players. Leading participants include The Western Union Company, MoneyGram International Inc., Wise PLC, PayPal Holdings Inc., WorldRemit Group Limited, Remitly Inc., Ria Money Transfer, and regional players like Mukuru Financial Services, Hello Paisa, and Mama Money.

The South African remittance market is witnessing a surge in digital payment solutions, with over 50% of transactions now conducted online. Innovations such as mobile wallets and peer-to-peer transfer platforms have simplified cross-border transactions.

Western Union and MoneyGram have had significant presence in Sub-Saharan Africa, with financial arrangements backing remittance receivables, including a $40 million medium-term loan in Ghana backed by Western Union remittance receivables, a $50 million remittance-backed facility for a Nigerian entity using MoneyGram receivables, and a $40 million facility for an Ethiopian bank using Western Union receivables.

By the last quarter of 2024, the leading competitor was Remitly—a company that began operating in 2013 and reached nearly 23 percent market share by 2024.

The remittance market is becoming increasingly competitive with fintech companies gaining ground against traditional players like Western Union and MoneyGram, particularly through digital platforms and mobile money services.

**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
In 2024, Sub-Saharan Africa received $56 billion in remittances. In 2025, Africa's cross-border payments market is valued at $329 billion, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. By 2035, the market is expected to surpass $1 trillion.

LemFi is processing over $1 billion monthly with $53 million in recent funding. LemFi has switched on low-cost transfers to Egypt, its 31st destination, unlocking a remittance corridor that saw Egyptians abroad send $20.6 billion home in 2024. The five-year-old startup now covers three North African markets — Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt — and serves more than two million users worldwide.

Ugandan Ham Serunjogi and Ghanaian Maijid Moujaled founded Chipper Cash in 2018, aiming to make cross-border payments as simple as sending a text. Five years on, the company has raised $337.2 million across seven rounds of funding, became a unicorn worth $2 billion, and seen its valuation cut by almost half. According to its website, it has over 5 million users, who can send money to 21 African countries including Malawi and Ethiopia.

WorldRemit is a digital cross border remittance business that provides international money transfer and remittance services in more than 130 countries and over 70 currencies. It was founded in 2010 by Ismail Ahmed, Catherine Wines, and Richard Igoe. The firm has a network of more than 5,000 corridors. It is connected to mobile money services globally, including Zaad (Somaliland), M-Pesa (Kenya), MTN (Africa and Asia), and bKash (Bangladesh).

Well-funded startups like LemFi, NALA, Flutterwave, and Chipper Cash compete aggressively for the Nigeria-Kenya-South Africa corridor. LemFi is up against Chipper Cash, WorldRemit, and a growing cast of local fintechs eyeing North Africa's diaspora flows.

The distribution of fintech innovation across the continent tells a paradoxical story: countries most dependent on remittances receive the least startup attention. The Gambia depends on remittances for over 21% of its GDP. Lesotho and Comoros also sit near the top of the list, with remittances making up around 20% of their economies.

New entrants face formidable competition from well-capitalized incumbents. Established players like Mukuru, Remitly, WorldRemit, and regional champions have spent years building payout networks, negotiating bank partnerships, and establishing regulatory compliance.

Digital solutions are quickly gaining traction. Since 2020, digital remittances usage has doubled, and Africa now accounts for 71% of mobile remittance value.

**REGION:** Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
International Transfers is a service that allows MoMo customers to send and receive money (cross border payments) to their family, friends, individuals within and across Africa.

MTN's mobile money platform, MoMo, processed $2.1 billion in international remittances across 14 markets in the first half of 2025, demonstrating significant growth in cross-border payments.

The MTN Mobile Money (MoMo) app has significantly expanded its international remittances capabilities by launching 25 additional wallet corridors in 10 new countries. With this extension, MoMo users can now send money to more than 200 million wallets, maintained by 39 partners, across 24 African countries.

The expansion benefits migrant populations in South Africa who send money home to Mozambique, Malawi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania are among the other countries where passageways have recently been opened. This is in addition to existing corridors including Zambia, Ghana, Cameroon, Rwanda, Uganda, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Congo Brazzaville, Benin, Guinea Conakry, and Guinea Bissau.

MTN SA's general manager for Fintech Products and Services stated: "With the addition of these new wallet corridors, we are furthering our commitment to facilitating seamless cross-border money transfers at a launch fee of 4%, which is lower than most competitors." All transactions made via the MTN MoMo app reflect instantly in the recipient's wallet. With a 4% sending fee, the service offers one of the most cost-effective solutions for cross-border remittances.

These services are delivered in partnership with MFS Africa and Saana Capital LLC.

According to McKinsey's research, international remittances via mobile-money wallets grew by 65% year on year in 2020 to around $1 billion, with no signs of slowing.

Only Tier 2 and 3 MoMo wallet customers can access this service, due to BVN/KYC being a requirement for inbound remittances. However, Tier 1 customers with Verified NINs can also receive. MoMo enables users to store, send, and receive money using their phone. No bank account is needed, and the service works on every type of cellphone, including 3G feature phones.

**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Mobile Money Statistics
**REGION:** Africa
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The global value of mobile money transactions reached $1.68 trillion, up 16% year-on-year. Cross-border remittances reached $34 billion globally in 2024.

Africa continued to dominate the global mobile money market in 2024, with mobile money services on the continent handling $1.105 trillion last year — a 15% increase compared to 2023. Africa processed 65% of global mobile money transaction value last year, or $1.1 trillion. The continent also led in volume, accounting for nearly 82 billion of the 108 billion global transactions.

In 2024, Africans paid over $100 billion to merchants via mobile money, a 21% increase from the previous year. Additionally, $34 billion was processed in international remittances into Africa—a global sector in which the continent leads.

A 2024 GSMA study found that the average cost of sending a cross-border mobile money remittance fell in 2024. With an average transfer fee of 3.54%, mobile money is the cheapest option for cross-border remittances. Despite this, mobile money makes up only 4% of global transfers.

East Africa remains the most active mobile money region with 459 million accounts and $649 billion in transactions in 2024. West Africa followed with 485 million accounts and $357 billion in transaction value, and Central Africa with 104 million accounts and $83 billion.

North Africa and Southern Africa are still lagging behind, with only 25 million and 27 million accounts, respectively. Their transaction values—$10 billion and $6 billion—also remain far lower, partly due to higher banking penetration rates in these regions.

According to the GSMA report, mobile money has added $190 billion to Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP, which has grown by $40 billion in just one year. In countries like Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, mobile money contributes between 5% and 8% of GDP.

Africa is home to more than half of all mobile money accounts globally. By the end of 2024, the continent had 1.1 billion registered accounts, representing 53% of the world total of 2.1 billion.

Transaction costs of remittances to African countries remain higher than any other region, and it is almost certain that the UN SDG of reducing them below 3% by 2030 will be missed. According to Remitscope, the average cost of remissions to Africa was 8.4% in Q1 2024.

## DOCUMENT 18: HAWALA INFORMAL REMITTANCE SYSTEMS AFRICA

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/reports/Role-of-hawala-and-similar-in-ml-tf.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Informal Channels
**REGION:** Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Hawala (Arabic: حِوالة ḥawāla, meaning transfer or sometimes trust), also known as xawala or xawilaad in Somali, is a popular and informal value transfer system based on the performance and honour of a huge network of money brokers (known as hawaladars). They operate outside of, or parallel to, traditional banking, financial channels and remittance systems. The system requires a minimum of two hawaladars that take care of the "transaction" without the movement of cash or telegraphic transfer.

The hundi is a related financial instrument that developed on the Indian sub-continent for use in trade and credit transactions. Hundis are used as a form of remittance instrument to transfer money from place to place, as a form of credit instrument or IOU to borrow money and as a bill of exchange in trade transactions.

Somalia has not had a functional banking system since the outbreak of the civil war in 1991. In the absence of banks, Hawala remittance companies emerged as a means of transferring money from the diaspora to Somalia. According to the CIA, with the dissolution of Somalia's formal banking system, many informal money transfer operators arose to fill the void. It estimates that such hawaladars, xawilaad or xawala brokers are now responsible for the transfer of up to $1.6 billion per year in remittances to the country, most coming from working Somalis outside Somalia.

Hawala serves as a "lifeline" to people in Somalia. Remittances sent from members of the diaspora to individuals in Somalia are used for necessities like food, healthcare, and education. More than 20 money transfer operators (MTOs) operate in Somalia today, with the market dominated by three main players: Dahabshiil, Amal Express, and Taaj.

Many remittance companies transfer money to other East African nations, including Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Sudan. According to Tawakal Express, a remittance agent with over 600 offices worldwide, money transfers can be made to Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, and Eritrea. Hawala agents operate in "poor and remote areas" that are "out of reach of the formal financial sector."

Hawala is a form of informal money transfer outside the banking system whereby Ethiopians in the diaspora remit foreign currency to middlemen, who pay the chosen beneficiary in Ethiopia in local currency at the black market rate. In August 2022, the Ethiopian National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) reported the arrest of several Ethiopian and foreign nationals allegedly involved in illicit financial flows and illegal hawala.

Many countries and communities, as well as the development community, view hawala systems as essential providers of financial services to the unbanked in countries with limited financial access. In significant numbers of jurisdictions and sometimes in the same jurisdiction, law enforcement views them as one of the leading channels for terrorist financing and money laundering.

Hawala-type informal transfers are often faster, more reliable, reach more destinations, sometimes benefit from a better exchange rate, and can be much cheaper than transfers through established, licensed financial institutions.

The different anti-money laundering regulations in various countries make it impractical to regulate the fund transfer system; in some countries, it is prohibited while in some, it is not. Policymakers need to either license or come up with registration policies for the system to make the regulation process more effective.

## DOCUMENT 19: BCEAO WEST AFRICA REMITTANCE REGULATIONS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.gide.com/en/news-insights/nouvelle-reglementation-des-changes-en-zone-uemoa-une-reforme-discrete-qui-renforce-le-controle-de-la-bceao-et-accentue-les-complexites-administratives-dans-la-region/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Regulatory/West Africa
**REGION:** WAEMU/BCEAO Zone
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) introduced a new foreign exchange regulation marking a major step in modernizing its regulatory framework. Introduced at the end of 2024, the reform gives the BCEAO tighter control of financial flows as part of the region's drive to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT). Adopted on 20 December 2024, the regulation on foreign exchange replaces the previous 2010 regulation.

The reform clarifies and strengthens the repatriation and foreign currency transfer requirements. WAEMU residents must repatriate income from foreign investments and loans and deposit it in their local bank accounts. In 2023, only 74% of the export revenue from outside the Union was returned to the Central Bank. To counter this, the new 2024 regulation sets strict rules: export earnings must be fully repatriated in two stages - first collected by an authorized intermediary (such as a local bank), then transferred to the BCEAO.

WAEMU residents require prior approval from the Ministry of Finance, after confirmation by the BCEAO, to open a foreign currency account either within or outside the region. Another key measure is increased monitoring of foreign currency accounts held abroad. Until now, businesses and individuals could open accounts outside the WAEMU area with some level of opacity. The new regulation now requires prior approval from the Ministry of Finance, after validation by the BCEAO.

BCEAO regulations require both mobile money and OTC service agents to register their businesses in the Registry of Trade and Property Credit or another equivalent registry. The same requirements apply to merchants who accept mobile money payments.

In 2015, BCEAO adopted new e-money regulatory guidelines. These guidelines clarified the roles and obligations of different stakeholders along the e-money value chain and set clear limits on the scope of activity allowed in mobile money accounts. By prohibiting agent exclusivity and setting clear obligations for price transparency, transaction values, distribution rights, and personal data protection, the guidelines also strengthen consumer protection.

Payment providers now have until August 31, 2025, to obtain official approval to operate legally in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). With this licensing effort, the BCEAO hopes to better organize digital finance services while still supporting innovation and broader access to financial tools. As of May 27, 2025, a total of 11 companies had received their licenses.

Financial inclusion in WAEMU has improved but remains below the Sub-Saharan average. Some 43 percent of the adult population has access to a transaction account. This is an improvement compared to the 8 percent of a decade ago, though performance is still below the Sub-Saharan African average of 55 percent.

## DOCUMENT 20: CENTRAL BANK NIGERIA KENYA REMITTANCE LICENSING

**SOURCE_URL:** https://aln.africa/insight/cbn-revised-guidelines-for-international-money-transfer-services/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Regulatory/National
**REGION:** Nigeria, Kenya
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**

**NIGERIA:**
The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on 31 January 2024 released the revised Guidelines for International Money Transfer Services in Nigeria, which effectively repealed the previous guidelines issued in 2014. The Guidelines were issued in light of the recent reforms to liberalise the foreign exchange market, and with the aim to boost diaspora remittances and other foreign capital inflows to Nigeria.

Unlike the 2014 Guidelines, the new Guidelines prescribe a two-level approval for a prospective IMTO licencee: Approval-in-Principle (AIP) and Final Approval.

The services include cross border personal money transfer services, such as money transfer services towards family maintenance, or in favour of foreign tourists visiting Nigeria. The money transfer shall target individual customers and the transaction shall be on "person to person", "business to person" and "business to business" transfer basis.

One key highlight of the New IMTO Guidelines is the prohibition of banks and financial technology companies (fintech companies) from operating international money transfer services. While fintech companies are prohibited from offering international money transfer services, banks are permitted to act as agents to IMTOs duly licensed by the CBN.

All in-bound money transfers to Nigeria shall be paid to beneficiaries in Naira only through a bank account or cash. IMTOs shall use the prevailing exchange rate at the Nigerian Foreign Exchange Market on the day the transfer is received. Where the amount exceeds the equivalent of USD 200, payment shall not be made in cash, but through an account.

**KENYA:**
Cross-border payments and remittances are regulated by the Money Remittance Regulations, under which any person who wishes to undertake "money remittance business" is required to obtain a licence from the CBK. "Money remittance business" is defined as a service for the transmission of money or any representation of monetary value without any payment accounts being created in the name of the payer or the payee.

Licensing under Money Remittance Regulations (2013) governs the establishment and operation of Money Remittance Operators (MROs). To provide money remittance services, a firm must be incorporated as a limited liability company and obtain an MRO license.

Banks and deposit-taking microfinance institutions are exempted from the Money Remittance Regulations and can undertake cross-border payments and remittances without the need to obtain a money remittance licence.

A money remittance operator must maintain an account entitled 'Customer's account' in the name of the licensee at any commercial bank. All foreign exchange inflows and outflows of money remittance operators must be received through commercial banks, documented and advised to the Central Bank in the prescribed format.

Kenya is globally recognized as the birthplace of mobile money innovation, thanks to M-Pesa. Over 90% of adults in Kenya use M-Pesa. Remittances can go directly into M-Pesa wallets—accessible within seconds. The Central Bank of Kenya authorizes who can handle international transfers.

## DOCUMENT 21: AML CFT COMPLIANCE IMPACT ON AFRICA REMITTANCES

**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Regulatory/AML-CFT
**REGION:** Africa
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
AML/CFT compliance requirements have created a marked increase in cost and complexity to banks globally. While many of these regulatory changes have increased financial system resilience and helped battle financial crime, they have also put increased pressure on correspondent banking relationships. These correspondent banking networks make trade possible, support remittances, and facilitate foreign currency settlements.

Over 25 percent of 300-plus banks in over 90 emerging markets reported correspondent bank relationship losses. Seventy-two percent of the banks covered by the study reported that they face exogenous challenges – primarily correspondent banking stress and related compliance challenges.

In Africa, pan-African collaborations focus on cross-border cooperation and closer alignment with FATF recommendations. AML/CFT regulatory frameworks have been in place across most countries, and these countries are committed to improving their AML/CFT regimes. Most regulatory frameworks cover vital AML/CFT aspects, including cross-border cash transportation, bearer negotiable instruments, and financial transaction transparency.

When the FATF places a jurisdiction under increased monitoring (also known as grey listing), it means the country has committed to resolve swiftly the identified strategic deficiencies. The FATF published their decision to include South Africa on its grey list on 24 February 2023. The FATF has identified South Africa as having a high risk for money laundering and terrorist funding due to its cash-based economy, which makes it difficult to track financial transactions, and weak border controls.

Measures include watchlist screening against FATF-recommended sanction lists to detect possible terrorism financing activity, including lists issued by the United Nations, European Union, His Majesty's Treasury, and the US Office of Foreign Assets Control. FATF Recommendation 14 on money or value transfer services requires countries to ensure that providers are licensed or registered and subject to effective compliance systems.

Money remittance and currency exchange services are vulnerable to financial crimes due to their global reach and other factors. These providers deal with millions of small transactions on a daily basis, which are complex to monitor and make them less transparent.

In 2025, AML compliance faces landmark shifts. New guidelines from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) emphasize enhanced National Risk Assessments (NRA) and transparency in beneficial ownership, pushing financial institutions to modernize or risk stiff fines, reputational damage, and legal repercussions.

**CONTENT:**
IFAD is partnering with APS under the PRIME Africa initiative to accelerate the uptake of digital remittance services among remittance recipients, and to remittance-linked microfinance services. IFAD is partnering with Fidelity Bank Ghana under the PRIME Africa Programme initiative to enable remittance recipients in high-migration rural areas to increase their share of remittances saved in formal bank accounts. By targeting un(der)banked remittance recipients, Fidelity Bank is enabling termination of remittances directly into a savings account.

With support from UNCDF, Wizall Money aims to improve lives of migrants and their families in four countries of the West Africa region (Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali and Senegal) by improving its remittance linked products: Wallet remittance termination, Nanocredit for migrants and their families, and Insurance for migrant family members.

IFAD is partnering with Stanbic Bank Uganda (SBU) under the PRIME Africa initiative to promote affordable digital remittances in rural Uganda. In 2021, SBU launched a new e-wallet named FlexiPay, with a simplified onboarding process that facilitates un(der)banked clients. The microfinance pioneer Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA International) also introduced a card-based solution and piloted the use of POS terminals in its branches in rural Uganda. FINCA International issued nearly 3,000 debit cards to its clients, enabling real-time authorization and processing of transfers at fees among the lowest in the country.

IFAD is partnering with Mama Money under the PRIME Africa initiative to maximize the impact of remittances sent by low-income migrants in South Africa to their remittance receiving families in Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The project responds to the growing need of migrant workers in South Africa to maximize their net income.

The cost of remittances is the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and in the Pacific Island countries (for example, it costs more than 20 percent to send $200 from Australia to Vanuatu, and 19 percent from South Africa to Zambia).

Migrant workers and their families need financial products which make it easier to send, receive and manage international money transfers, and to save and invest their income. Microfinance is well-suited for remittance-linked financial services, particularly among poor and geographically isolated populations.

With the recent increased popularity of microfinance, a number of microfinance institutions are looking into provision of remittance services. Some microfinance institutions are beginning to use the history of remittances as a way to evaluate creditworthiness of their poor customers who often cannot provide proof of income.

The ILO has developed financial education training tools and programmes and has carried out trainings in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, and Senegal. The ILO has also carried out action research on migrant remittances and microfinance in various countries including Senegal and South Africa.

**CERTAINTY:** Medium

**CONTENT:**
Increasingly, there are threads of discourse linking migration and microfinance. MFIs (sometimes with the support of development institutions) are targeting migrant households for a variety of microfinance services, including loan products. These organizations view microfinance institutions as ideal actors through which to empower migrant households.

Migrants—and the potential remittances they represent—offer a lucrative new market. As a result, MFIs are now considering not only money-transfer services for migrants but also credit products specifically tailored for migrant households.

Agriland Microfinance offers "Agri-Kilimo Loans" - seasonal financing tailored to meet farm investment needs, empowering farmers with microfinance, agricultural loans, and savings solutions across Kenya and East Africa.

Advans Tunisia has developed an individual loan called "Crédit Saba" enabling smallholder farmers to borrow up to 13,000€, with a flexible repayment plan adapted to the seasonality of their activities and their cash flows, as well as a grace period in case of an extreme climate event.

Agricultural loans traditionally never exceed a period of ten months in Africa, and cooperatives are often forced to sell harvested produce immediately at the least profitable time to meet stringent input loan reimbursement deadlines.

In 2020, about 70,000 Ethiopian migrants were in Sudan. Two broad sets of movements dominate Ethiopian migration to Sudan, including agricultural work mobilizing thousands of seasonal workers intervening in commercial farms in eastern Sudan.

The F2.0 platform is streamlining agricultural finance in Sub-Saharan Africa via an online platform which connects MFIs to remote smallholder farmers and their cooperatives. While MFIs benefit from streamlined loan management and reduced risk, farmers can open a bank account and access financing to receive timely inputs.

SympliFi has adjusted its loan product so that guarantors can choose how much they wish to put down as a refundable deposit. However, the product faced challenges from regulatory frameworks because it would hold deposits in sending countries (EU, UK) and then use those deposits as a loan guarantee in receiving countries like Senegal.

The funds sent home by migrant workers are a lifeline for rural families, helping to build resilience and support sustainable development.

**CONTENT:**
Kredete, a Nigerian fintech startup, uses remittance behaviour to create a verifiable transaction history that can be leveraged to create a credit profile for the user. The company recently announced raising $22 million in Series A funding from AfricInvest, Partech, and Polymorphic Capital, bringing its total funding to $24.75 million.

Kredete's platform enables users to build credit scores as they send money back home, bridging the gap between remittances and financial inclusion. Additionally, it offers a cross-border payment solution for businesses and recently launched a stablecoin-backed credit card that leverages blockchain technology for faster and more secure transactions.

TransUnion is considering ways to incorporate cross-border transaction data into credit scoring models. Regular remittances sent or received could serve as credible proof of income and repayment reliability, enabling greater credit access.

African migrants send home close to $100 billion annually. According to the World Bank, remittances to Africa totalled over $92.2 billion in 2024, roughly twice the level of overseas development assistance.

Within Africa, 19 of the 54 countries rely on remittances for at least 4% of their GDP. Yet Africa remains the most expensive region in the world to send money to—in Q1 2024, the cost of sending $200 to sub-Saharan Africa averaged 8.4% compared to a global average of 6.4%.

There are questions about data quality: Can remittance data accurately produce predictive credit signals, and are cross-border flows enough to model borrower risk? The answer depends on the strength of local partnerships, low-cost acquisition channels, and robust alternative-data underwriting models.

Rising globalization has fuelled immigration, with migrants contributing significantly to the economic growth of their adopted country. Despite financial inclusion being in the spotlight, the migrant community faces severe challenges in accessing financial services, especially credit, due to the lack of a credit history.

As countries improve their digital payment systems and ecosystem and the financial inclusion of the population increases, people can swap to digital remittance services. Sending and receiving remittances is often the first interaction that people have with formal financial services and therefore can be a catalyst to drive financial inclusion.

Africa has leapfrogged traditional internet banking, widely adopting mobile money and digital wallets that offer faster, more affordable alternatives. Exemplified by Kenya's M-Pesa, these platforms facilitate rapid money transfers through mobile networks.

With a global credit score, financial institutions in any country can access and use immigrants' credit history from their home country. This would be a win-win situation for both banks and immigrants, allowing banks to tap into this largely underserved segment while promoting financial inclusion.

## DOCUMENT 25: INSURANCE FOR MIGRANT WORKERS AFRICA

**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Opportunities/Insurance Products
**REGION:** Africa
**CERTAINTY:** Medium

**CONTENT:**
Lump-sum payments provide limited protection compared to regular pension payments. From an African perspective, migrant workers often fail to qualify for benefits under contributory social insurance schemes, owing to shorter periods of employment and residence or because of their status as non-nationals. The lack of bilateral or multilateral agreements may prevent migrant workers from continuing to receive benefits when they move from one country to another.

Kenya is committed to ensuring that workers abroad enjoy strong protection and access to social security benefits. Through partnerships with key GCC countries, Kenya is embedding clear enforcement criteria and reviewing policies regularly to safeguard workers' rights.

Oman is paving the way for a new model for the entire region, having recently introduced legislation that gives migrant workers access to national social insurance coverage across multiple work and lifecycle risks. However, "Social security contributions made in destination countries are rarely transferable to origin countries. A worker who spends years contributing abroad may return home without being able to access those benefits."

Remittance-linked insurance products, although still facing many 'grey areas', have had some success at improving uptake, with examples including Fintech Inclusivity Solutions, AXA, Rise, HelloPaisa - Democrance, also allowing for bundling of insurance across different types of remittance services.

Remittances provide a financial safety net for vulnerable households across Africa by enabling the diaspora to send money home. Investment is helping develop new business lines such as micro-insurance and data-analytics.

Diaspora Insurance is a global insurance consultancy firm headquartered in Birmingham, United Kingdom, specializing in the designing, marketing and distribution of insurance products and risk management solutions targeted at expatriates and Diasporans. Their global insurance solutions enable diasporans to cover themselves abroad and also their families in their countries of origin.

Mutual Life Africa's Diaspora Life Cover offers a lump-sum payout in GBP, usable anywhere — for education, mortgages, healthcare, or daily living expenses — ensuring families remain financially protected and supported.

In 2023, remittance flows to low and middle-income countries reached $656 billion, surpassing foreign direct investment (FDI) and official development assistance (ODA). Among policy actions to leverage remittances for investment and development, channeling remittances through formal channels provides recipients with access to formal banking and financial products such as saving accounts, insurance, and credit facilities.

## DOCUMENT 26: MOBILE MONEY INTEROPERABILITY AND PAPSS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://papss.com/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Opportunities/Technology Infrastructure
**REGION:** Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
PAPSS is revolutionizing intra-African trade by eliminating reliance on foreign currencies and reducing transaction costs. Launched to support the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), PAPSS enables real-time, cost-effective transactions in local currencies, fostering financial autonomy and accelerating economic integration.

By early 2025, PAPSS had enabled real-time cross-border payments across 17 countries, connecting 14 national switches and over 150 commercial banks. As of August 2025, 18 African countries have joined the PAPSS network, connecting multiple regions across the continent through their central banks and numerous commercial banks.

PAPSS supports three core processes: instant payment, pre-funding and net settlement. With instant payment, participants no longer need to convert local currencies into hard currencies which then entailed the funds leaving Africa to be converted before being sent back again. Compliance, legal and sanctions checks are performed instantly within the system, with near-instant payments processing within 120 seconds.

PAPSS uses the ISO 20022 global message standard allowing interoperability, large data sets and rich data for payment and remittance information, with secure infrastructure incorporating cyber-security and payment fraud systems.

PAPSS also promotes financial inclusion by enabling mobile money platforms to integrate with the system, offering cross-border payment solutions and extending financial services to underbanked populations.

However, significant challenges remain: With over 171 mobile money options in Africa, most wallets (e.g., M-Pesa, MTN Mobile Money) operate in isolation. Even within one country, interoperability is rare, let alone across borders. PAPSS connects banks, but wallets lag behind due to proprietary systems and lack of open APIs. PAPSS connects banks, yet digital wallets—where much of Africa's financial activity actually occurs—remain poorly integrated.

Integrating PAPSS with existing national payment systems requires substantial technological and financial investments. Each country has its own payment infrastructure, regulatory frameworks, and operational standards. Some national systems may not yet support real-time payments or currency conversion, necessitating significant upgrades.

Regulatory fragmentation exists, where each country has its own rules including KYC standards, data protection laws, and licensing requirements.

Recent innovations, such as the integration of PAPSS into mobile banking apps for small and medium enterprises and diaspora remittance corridors, further democratize access to Africa's integrated financial future.

The regulation of domestic infrastructure, the introduction of national switches, and their integration are essential. Countries must connect national switches, such as Tanzania's TIPS and Rwanda's RSwitch, to PAPSS and standardize AML/KYC regulations to improve interoperable digital infrastructure and promote local currency settlement.

The PAPSS system enables cross-border payments in local currencies, reducing transaction costs. PSPs that integrate with PAPSS can capitalise on the growing demand for intra-African trade and cross-border remittances.

## DOCUMENT 27: BLOCKCHAIN DLT REMITTANCES AFRICA

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.tralac.org/publications/article/12938-distributed-ledger-technology-opportunities-for-africa-s-trade.html
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Opportunities/Technology Solutions
**REGION:** Africa
**CERTAINTY:** Medium

**CONTENT:**
Cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt remittances in Africa, which many people rely on. Many exciting developments are occurring in the distributed ledger technology (DLT) and blockchain space in Africa, with much opportunity existing on the continent to leverage the benefits of blockchain in reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and ensuring trust and security in various applications.

DLT enables peer-to-peer payments. Bitcoin's blockchain ledger records all BTC transfers immutably, used by millions for remittances (e.g., in El Salvador, where Bitcoin is legal tender).

Stablecoins are blockchain-based digital tokens pegged to a stable asset, such as the U.S. dollar. One of the best-known stablecoins, USDC, is issued by Circle, a regulated American company, and fully backed by dollar reserves and short-term treasuries.

In Africa, a new variant is emerging: the EMDE (Emerging Market and Developing Economy) stablecoin. Pegged to local currencies and backed by a mix of hard-currency reserves and real housing assets, these tokens connect foreign investors and local borrowers within a transparent, programmable ecosystem.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, fewer than 3% of adults hold a mortgage; in Nigeria or Uganda, closer to 1%. Most families earn income informally, through trade, gig work or remittances—cash flows too irregular for banks to assess.

A distributed ledger (also called a shared ledger or distributed ledger technology or DLT) is a system whereby replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data is geographically spread (distributed) across many sites, countries, or institutions. In contrast to a centralized database, a distributed ledger does not require a central administrator, and consequently does not have a single (central) point-of-failure.

Importers and exporters can have peace of mind when dealing with clients in distant countries, where the language and business culture may be very different. The entry into the ledger of dispatch information, shipping details, customs declarations and payments, fees payments, transit locations and final delivery all serve to greatly enhance transparency, and consequently, trust. A DLT-driven trade details ledger will also speed up cross-border trade considerably.

DLT holds much promise for the world of global trade. In many ways, Africa stands to benefit more than the developed world, in a relative sense, because Africa can transfer the technology when it is ready and skip many of the intermediate steps—similar to how Africa benefited by skipping the landline phase of internet connectivity and moving directly to wireless smart devices.

The future of money is digital, regulated and interoperable. The Universal Digital Payments Network (UDPN) is a DLT-underpinned messaging backbone focused on providing interoperability between regulated stablecoins and, in the future, CBDCs, offering lower payment costs than traditional solutions.

## DOCUMENT 28: DIGITAL IDENTITY MIGRANTS CROSS-BORDER KYC

**SOURCE_URL:** https://migrantmoney.uncdf.org/resources/insights/central-bank-led-digital-id-to-drive-cross-border-payments-and-financial-inclusion/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Opportunities/Digital Infrastructure
**REGION:** Southern Africa (SADC), Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The challenge facing Southern Africa exemplifies why DPI matters: 3.7 million SADC nationals living outside their home countries face systematic financial exclusion despite most member states having foundational digital identity systems. Poor interoperability between national ID platforms and financial service providers creates barriers that force millions to rely on informal, cash-based transactions.

The SADC Committee of Central Bank Governors, FinMark Trust and Co-Develop have announced a strategic partnership to build a federated electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) ecosystem spanning 16 member states. The partnership builds on validated results from FinMark Trust's pilot programme between Lesotho and South Africa, which successfully demonstrated real-time, cross-border identity verification. Lesotho migrants were able to access formal remittances services in South Africa using their national digital IDs.

Nearly half a billion Africans still lack a foundational ID. While approximately 85% of African countries have national ID systems with some digital capabilities, and over 70% collect biometric data for authentication, full inclusion remains an uphill climb. About 100 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa don't have access to formal identification documents, a barrier to adopting regulated and finance platforms.

Identification is the cornerstone of financial services, as all financial service providers must verify their customers' identity under 'know-your-customer' (KYC) rules. These guidelines require individuals to present official identification documents to open accounts and conduct transactions. However, in many jurisdictions, a significant number of people lack the necessary identity documents, preventing them from accessing financial services.

Digital IDs simplify KYC processes, enabling more people to access financial services and formal remittance channels, leading to faster and more secure cross-border transactions.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)'s National Biometric ID Card is another example of encouraging the free movement of people in the region by replacing residential permits and removing the need to use visas.

At the heart of this vision is a transformative idea: A unified digital identity system — Africa's own KYC (Know Your Customer) — is the foundation for a digital single market.

Mastercard has extended its strategic commercial partnership with Smile ID, an identity verification provider in Africa to accelerate the rollout of secure digital identity solutions across the continent. This partnership will enable banks, fintechs, mobile money operators and other enterprises to onboard new customers faster, reducing identity fraud and expanding access to the financial system.

As Africa's digital economy is projected to reach $1.5 trillion by 2030, trusted identity solutions are a critical enabler of financial inclusion, fraud prevention, and cross-border commerce.

Despite these promises, concerns over privacy, security, and exclusion are growing. Critics, including Privacy International and Access Now, have raised alarm over the risks posed by poorly regulated digital ID systems.

## DOCUMENT 29: TOP AFRICAN REMITTANCE RECEIVING COUNTRIES 2024

**SOURCE_URL:** https://visual-nerd.com/2025/01/21/top-remittance-receiving-countries-2024/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Major Recipients
**REGION:** Egypt, Morocco, Ghana, Kenya
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Remittances sent by the African diaspora reached a historic figure of USD 100 billion in 2024. According to the World Bank, over $96.4 billion flowed into Africa in remittances, which is approximately twice the level of overseas development assistance.

**EGYPT:**
Egypt maintained its position as Africa's leading recipient of remittances in 2024, with inflows reaching $22.7 billion. This significant increase was driven by economic reforms, including the liberalization of exchange rates and higher interest rates on savings instruments, which encouraged Egyptians abroad to utilize formal banking channels.

**MOROCCO:**
Remittances to Morocco totalled $12.0 billion in 2024. Morocco's diaspora contributed $12.05 billion in remittances in 2024, reflecting the strong ties between Moroccans abroad and their homeland.

**KENYA:**
Kenya saw a record $4.94 billion in remittances in 2024, marking an 18% increase from the previous year. The United States remained the largest source, contributing 51% of total inflows. The Kenyan government has actively encouraged labor migration, with President William Ruto promoting opportunities abroad to address domestic unemployment. Remittances have become Kenya's largest source of foreign exchange, surpassing tourism and agricultural exports.

**GHANA:**
Ghana recorded $4.6 billion in remittances. Ghana received $4.6 billion in remittances in 2024, underscoring the significant role of its diaspora in supporting the national economy. These funds are essential for household consumption, education, and healthcare, and they contribute to poverty reduction and economic stability.

Egypt, Nigeria and Morocco accounted for the largest shares of Africa's remittance inflows in 2024. Regionally, North and West Africa attracted the highest overall remittance volumes. Remittance inflows continue to grow with a 7% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in the 3 years to 2024 despite global headwinds.

## DOCUMENT 30: AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK REMITTANCE PROGRAMS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/initiatives-partnerships/migration-and-development-initiative
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Opportunities/Development Programs
**REGION:** Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The African Development Bank has assigned a high priority to the promotion of remittance flows as a development tool and a link to the private sector. The overall objective of AfDB's Initiative on Migration and Development is to maximize the development impact of remittances by increasing their canalization into productive investments and promoting business opportunities and job creation at the grassroots level.

AfDB aims to support the development of financial services for migrant workers and create incentives to channel funds into productive uses in the country of origin.

In 2009, the AfDB hosted the Migration and Development multi-donor trust fund in support of its initiative "Migration and Development." As a joint initiative by the AfDB and France, the Fund finances activities aimed at improving knowledge on migrants' remittances in Africa; assisting the reform of regulatory frameworks in order to improve the conditions of transfer; developing new financial products that respond better to the needs of migrants, and supporting the initiatives of migrants in productive investment and local development in their country of origin.

This meets the recommendations of the G20 to reduce transfer costs and to promote financial inclusion. The initial contributors are France (EUR 6 million) and IFAD (USD 200,000).

The program assists the reform of regulatory frameworks by modernizing regulatory frameworks and operators to enhance financial markets for the benefit of migrants and beneficiaries. It also focuses on developing and testing new financial products that respond better to the needs and capacities of migrants and beneficiaries, which can be risky and expensive for financial intermediaries, particularly microfinance institutions.

One main objective is to promote the financial intermediaries' engagement through cofinancing or other forms of support. Another component aims to assist migrants in the creation of SMEs and promote the creation of private equity and investment funds for advancing innovative SME projects that involve migrants and local entrepreneurs.

An estimated 30 to 40 percent of remittances to Africa are sent to rural areas where banking facilities are generally non-existent. As a result, people travel long distances to receive their money. This cost of travel represents an additional burden to the already high cost of transfer. Expanding payment networks to small-scale merchants and encouraging the adoption of new technologies such as payments through the Internet or mobile phones can widen the reach of remittances and enhance financial inclusion.

Remittances play a vital role in many African economies. From being the second largest source of external financial flows between 1980 and 2000, ranking between Official Development Assistance (ODA) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), they have surpassed ODA and FDI flows since 2010.

More than 1 in 4 people in Sub-Saharan Africa lack access to financial services, which limits their ability to overcome persistent and new crises, notably conflict, climate disruptions and migration.

As stated by AfDB President Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, "The African diaspora has become the largest financier of Africa! And it is not debt; it is 100% gifts or grants, a new form of concessional financing that is the key for livelihood security for millions of Africans."

## DOCUMENT 31: LESOTHO REMITTANCES SOUTH AFRICA MINING WORKERS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://scholars.wlu.ca/samp/45/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Corridors/Mining Labor/Circular Migration
**REGION:** Lesotho-South Africa
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Lesotho is one of the most migration dependent countries in the world. Migrant remittances are the country's major source of foreign exchange, accounting for 25% of GDP in 2006. According to the World Bank, the remittances received in 2020 constituted 25.1 percent of the Lesotho GDP.

It would be difficult to exaggerate the significance of labor migration in Lesotho's economy. Over a quarter of the male labor force of Lesotho is engaged in mine employment in South Africa. These workers are typically on fixed-term contracts spanning 12 months which require them to return to Lesotho before a renewal.

The migrants' remittances make up over 80% of factor income from abroad which constituted 40% to 50% of Lesotho's gross national product during 1983–91. At the household level, remittances from migrant laborers in South Africa are the main source of income for about 35% of homesteads and 70% of households have had at least one member as a migrant worker.

The number of Basotho male migrants working on the mines declined from 100,000 in 1990 to 46,000 in 2006. However, the majority of male migrants from Lesotho are still mineworkers. The backbone of Basotho remittances from South Africa has traditionally been the mining industry, which employed large numbers of Basotho. However, these numbers have declined rapidly. For example, while almost 65,000 Basotho were employed on South African mines in 2000, by 2015 that number had declined to only 27,948. By late 2010, the number of mineworkers from Lesotho was estimated to be fewer than 43,000.

Migrants used to be single young men. Now 84% are married and 77% are heads of households. Nearly 50% of migrants are over the age of 40 and only 5% are under 25.

The vast majority of cash remittances flow through informal channels (usually carried by hand). In 2001 in Lesotho, remittances were estimated to contribute as much as 26.5% of GDP. To encourage remittances, under bi-lateral agreements, Lesotho and Mozambican mineworkers receive part of their pay as deferred pay.

Half of the growing number of female migrants from Lesotho are domestic workers in South Africa. The rest are spread between the informal sector (9%), commercial farmwork (5%), self-employed businesses (6%), the professions (5%) and skilled manual work (5%). Female domestic workers in South Africa remit less to Lesotho than male miners. This is primarily because they earn about a third as much as their male counterparts.

As a percentage of GDP, Lesotho was the highest recipient of remittances in the sub-region in 2019. The consequences for Lesotho of the end of new legal migration to work in South African mines and the retrenchment of migrants have been devastating. They have been exacerbated by population growth, political instability, drought, continuing soil erosion, and the peculiarities of the country's limited economic development.

## DOCUMENT 32: SENEGAL MALI GUINEA REMITTANCES WEST AFRICA

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.migrationdataportal.org/regional-data-overview/western-africa
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Corridors
**REGION:** West Africa (Senegal, Mali, Guinea)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Labour migration in West Africa takes many forms, including temporary, seasonal and permanent migration, and implicates many sectors of employment, such as mining in Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal. Every year, thousands of seasonal workers from West and Central Africa travel to gold mining areas in Burkina Faso, Senegal or Mali.

Côte d'Ivoire hosts more than 8 million migrants from Burkina Faso, 402,000 from Mali, and 112,000 from Guinea.

Based on the 2000 Census Round Data, the number of Malians abroad was estimated to be in excess of 1.5 million, with 32% living and working in Côte d'Ivoire, 28% in Burkina Faso, 10% in Guinea, 6% in Nigeria and 5% in Ghana. Immigration to Mali is mostly regional, with migrants coming from Burkina Faso (23%), Ghana (13%), Guinea (10%), Benin (9%) and Niger (8%).

84% of the estimated 100,000 mostly irregular migrants currently living in Mauritania come from neighbouring countries, particularly Senegal (38%) and Mali (28%) but also from Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea-Bissau.

Western African countries received 27 billion USD in remittances in 2020. Nigeria, the largest recipient in Sub-Saharan Africa in absolute terms, received nearly 64% of this total (17.2 billion). Senegal's remittances received saw a record increase of 67% from 1.5 billion USD in 2010 to 2.5 billion USD in 2019. Regionwide, total remittances increased 43% between 2010 and 2019, from 23.6 billion USD to 33.7 billion.

In some cases remittances represent more than 7% of the country's GDP. In three countries, this percentage is much higher: Liberia (20.4%), The Gambia (15.4%), and Senegal (11.4%). For Mali, remittances reached 212 million USD in 2007, representing 3.3% of the country's GDP.

Remittances sent from the top ECOWAS countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Niger, and Togo) exceed those sent from the top OECD countries. The highest remittance flows to the majority of the countries come from a West African country, although an OECD country is the top sending country in seven cases (Cape Verde, The Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Nigeria, and Senegal).

In rural Mali, remittances responded positively to shocks suffered by recipient households. Surveys in the Senegal River Valley in Mali and in Senegal suggest that migration acts as an intrahousehold risk-diversification strategy, with remittances a contingent flow that supports family consumption in case of an adverse shock.

Mali was the leading country of origin for irregular migration to Europe in 2024, totaling roughly 16,500 people. In 2023, Guinea topped the list with approximately 21,700 individuals. ECOWAS enjoys freedom of movement for its documented citizens. As a result, an estimated 6 million people have moved within ECOWAS.

## DOCUMENT 33: SOMALIA DJIBOUTI REMITTANCES DIASPORA HAWALA

**SOURCE_URL:** https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/597711594118138283/pdf/Summary-of-Chapter-6-Remittances.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Diaspora/Informal Systems
**REGION:** Somalia, Djibouti, Horn of Africa
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The Somali diaspora includes two million people worldwide, keeping up strong economic and cultural links to Somalia. There are about two million Somalis living outside the country, mostly in African countries although most remittances come from diaspora living in Europe, the United States and Canada.

Somalis primarily migrate to Kenya, Ethiopia, Yemen, Libya, UK, Djibouti, the U.S., and Sweden, in descending order. Before the 1990s, Somali migration had focused on the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf. Sweden has one of Europe's biggest Somali communities, with over 60,000 residents, mostly thanks to Sweden's generous refugee policies in the 1990s. The UK became a major destination because of colonial ties with British Somaliland.

The Somali diaspora sends between $1.4 billion and $2 billion in remittances annually to Somalia, supporting approximately half of all households in the country and preventing economic collapse. The Somali diaspora generates about $1.74 billion in annual remittances and makes up 15% of Somalia's GDP.

The financial support provided by Somali migrants is estimated at 1.4 billion USD remitted in 2018, which is equivalent to 25 percent of Somalia's GDP and outpaces international aid and foreign direct investment. 40% of Somali households rely on remittances to meet food security needs.

Average amount of international remittances received per household per year is US$ 743—above the average per capita income of Somalia of US$ 535 for 2017. Amount of remittances households receive varies from US$505 to US$876 for international remittances to US$138 to US$525 for domestic remittances.

With no official banks, remittances sent through a system called the hawala, the Arabic word for "transfer," rose as an alternative. The hawala had begun in the 1970s when Somali migrant workers were trying to get around the country's foreign exchange controls. Migrant workers in the Middle East used the informal system to send money back home to families.

Following the civil war, remittances flowed mainly through the hawala system. More than 20 MTOs operate in Somalia today, with the market dominated by three main players: Dahabshiil, Amal Express, and Taaj.

Domestic remittances are conducted overwhelmingly through mobile money (46 percent), money transfer operators (47 percent), and informal channels such as hawala. International remittances are largely channeled through money transfer operators (87 percent) and mobile phone (12 percent). With weak formal banking systems, and a deep distrust of the local currency, mobile money use has surged. In 2017, the World Bank estimated that 73% of Somalis over the age of 16 use mobile money services.

Up to 80% of starting capital for small and medium enterprises comes from the diaspora. Remittances have contributed to the growth of industries and services as diverse as real estate, transportation, imports of consumer goods, construction of hospitals and schools.

Costs of remitting money to Somalia have increased. Since 2001, many countries have adopted stringent Anti-Money Laundering and Combatting the Financing of Terror (AML/CFT) regulations. Financial institutions have "de-risked" by terminating or restricting relationships with clients perceived as high risk. Several banks in Australia, the U.S., and UK have closed money services business accounts.

The traditional informal hawala networks – typically used by an older generation of Somalis – have been flagged by Western security services as a potential concern for money laundering and terrorism financing.

**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Mobile Money/East Africa Corridor
**REGION:** Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
East Africa has been the traditional home of mobile money for over a decade, with Kenya achieving the top MobileRemit index score (97), and Rwanda (92) and Tanzania (90) also attaining high scores. In East Africa, countries like Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania are leading by example in the adoption of mobile remittances, as reported by the MobileRemit Index prepared by IFAD.

In countries like Uganda and Tanzania, mobile money penetration exceeds 60% of the adult population, according to the World Bank's Global Findex Database.

In 2023, East Africa processed over 2 billion mobile money transactions monthly, with Kenya and Tanzania leading. The region's mobile money accounts grew from 160 million in 2018 to 300 million by 2023.

In Uganda, P2P transfers accounted for $28.6 billion in transaction value in 2023, a 29% increase from the previous year, according to the Bank of Uganda. Africa processed 65% of global mobile money transaction value last year, or $1.1 trillion. The continent also led in volume, accounting for nearly 82 billion of the 108 billion global transactions.

M-Pesa has expanded its utility into cross-border remittances, enabling instant transfers to Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda. Globally, cross-border remittances via mobile money reached $34 billion in 2024.

At an average marginal cost of 61 percent, the Tanzania to Uganda corridor is the continent's most costly remittance corridor. Average remittance costs on the Rwanda-Kenya corridor have halved since data collection began in 2016. The lowest costs in this corridor are those of mobile money operator MTN at 4.03 percent.

The African remittance market remains the most expensive, with an average cost of 7.83 percent against the global average of 6 percent. Mobile transfer costs are already in line with the SDG target of 3 percent.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, mobile money's contribution to GDP rose from around $150 billion in 2022 to $190 billion in 2023. The industry helped boost GDP by more than 5% in about a dozen African countries, including Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania. Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda top the global volume of mobile money transfers.

## DOCUMENT 35: INFORMAL REMITTANCES AFRICA STATISTICS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://futures.issafrica.org/blog/2025/Rethinking-remittances-the-overlooked-billions-sustaining-African-households
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Informal Channels
**REGION:** Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** Medium

**CONTENT:**
Informal remittances that are not systematically included in balance of payments can be significant in volume and can account for 35 to 75 per cent of formal remittances, particularly in the context of South-South corridors. Some analysts suggest that informal remittances could account for as much as 50% of the total amount sent through formal channels.

Surveys of migrants and remittance recipients suggest that informal remittance flows could be equal to or exceed official figures for Sub-Saharan Africa.

A substantial share of Africa's remittances move through informal channels, such as hand-carried cash or unregistered transfer systems, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Libya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and Nigeria. Data from Uganda imply that a large share of remittances enter the country informally. This is consistent with the results on Sub-Saharan Africa from aggregate estimation, which support high informal flows to the region.

Informal remittances are those sent through unlicensed or unregistered means. These flows have typically been cash-based—either in the form of cash physically carried across borders, sent with family and friends, cash given to bus or truck drivers crossing borders, or through unlicensed money transfer providers, including those using the hawala system.

Unregistered M-PESA agents accept Ugandan Shillings from customers and top up wallets or send Kenyan Shillings on their behalf. For many senders using this method, they did not know that their preferred method is informal. The practice is not unlike the traditional hawala system, but with an updated digital approach.

In 2023, Africa received $100 billion in remittances, equaling nearly 6 per cent of the continent's GDP and exceeding Official Development Assistance (ODA) of $42 billion and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of $48 billion. In 2024, according to the World Bank, over $96.4 billion flowed into Africa in remittances, which is approximately twice the level of overseas development assistance.

The multiple guidelines governing acceptable forms of personal identification, maximum transaction sizes, licensing requirements for money-transfer operators, etc., combine to create a formal remittance market of such formidable complexity that it often drives customers to use simpler but riskier informal alternatives.

In Africa, many countries still practice various forms of currency control, resulting in a divergence between the parallel and the market exchange rate and a diversion of flows to informal, unrecorded channels. The average cost of sending money through mobile applications to Africa was around 5% of the amount transferred in 2023, far above the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of 3% by 2030.

This reliance on unregistered intermediaries not only hampers efforts to promote financial inclusion and transparency but also obscures the true scale of diaspora support, limiting the effectiveness of evidence-based policymaking.

Due to the largely unknown scope of informal transfers, some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, do not report remittances figures to the IMF in their balance of payments.

## DOCUMENT 36: BANK-BASED REMITTANCES AFRICA COMPETITION

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.un.org/osaa/news/reducing-remittance-costs-africa-path-resilient-financing-development
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Providers/Commercial Banks
**REGION:** Africa
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
World Bank research shows that banks remain the most expensive service providers on African remittance corridors. This is because banks tend to charge a flat fee which is usually a high percentage of the value of the remittance. Remittances are typically small sums, especially when compared to commercial transactions. Banks however have the advantage of a near universal presence which means that remittances do eventually get through, albeit at a higher cost.

According to the World Bank, the average cost of sending $200 to Africa was 8.5 per cent of the amount transferred compared to less than 6 per cent globally in 2022. Sending money to some African countries, such as Angola, Botswana and Namibia, can sometimes cost as high as 20 per cent of the amount transferred.

Most African countries restrict the payment of remittances to banks, which in turn, typically enter into exclusive arrangements with large money transfer companies, like Western Union or Money Gram, to operate on their behalf. The African remittance market is characterized by limited or lack of competition among the remittance service providers (RSPs). The major money transfer companies (Western Union and MoneyGram) control about 65% of all remittance payout locations.

Since 2014, the ADLA license has allowed non-bank institutions to provide cross-border payment services, like remittances, with different levels of capital needed for each tier. This new system led to more competition and lower prices since its start.

BankservAfrica has noted that "By opening up the market to more players on an interoperable platform, this payment system enables both banks and non-banks (such as money transfer operators, or fintechs) to access regional cross border payment infrastructure."

Policymakers must work to make sure remittance service providers do not face difficulties in partnering with correspondent banks. Opening access of money transfer operators (MTOs) to partnerships with national post offices, national banks, and telecommunications companies could help remove entry barriers and increase competition in remittance markets.

Reducing remittance costs can be achieved by removing exclusivity arrangements in the money transfer industry, facilitating the entrance of new players into the market, harmonizing competition regulatory frameworks, reducing bond and capital requirements, promoting new technologies, and developing the payment systems infrastructure.

**CONTENT:**
Remittances serve as a vital lifeline for more than 200 million Africans. Beyond supporting the lives and livelihoods of families in the senders' countries of origin, these transfers represent solidarity and symbolize the generosity and resilience of the African community on the continent and beyond. In 2023, Africa received $100 billion in remittances, equaling nearly 6 per cent of the continent's GDP and exceeding Official Development Assistance ($42 billion) and Foreign Direct Investment ($48 billion).

Digital remittances, particularly mobile money, have emerged as the most cost-effective way for families to send and receive money. The development of user-friendly mobile applications compatible with basic smartphones in many African countries fueled this growth, expanding the reach of digital remittance services to areas lacking traditional banking infrastructure.

Partnerships between money transfer operators and local financial institutions allow unbanked individuals to access other financial services, such as credit, insurance, and savings accounts.

Migrants and diaspora contribute through direct investments, skills transfer, and knowledge networks, further enhancing economic and social development in their countries of origin. Providing appropriate investment instruments and vehicles is crucial to facilitate the diaspora's appetite and ability to invest, particularly in countries and regions facing challenges to mobilize capital.

Developing remittance ecosystems around basic social services like education and health can also help lower remittance transfer costs, with service providers able to offer bundled services at lower costs. For instance, remittance operators can work with local providers to propose an education and healthcare combo that includes tuition coverage, school supplies fees and health insurance subscription. While reducing remittance costs, this strategy also increases financial inclusion, facilitating access to education and health services in the recipient countries.

Kenya is the third largest remittance recipient in sub-Saharan Africa and the fifth largest receiving country in Africa. In 2023, according to the Central Bank of Kenya, remittance flows reached almost US$4.2 billion, accounting for nearly 3.6 per cent of the country's GDP and representing a leading source of foreign exchange. The Kenyan Government established The State Department for Diaspora Affairs (SDDA) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Its mandate includes specific references to supporting remittances and diaspora investments in Kenya.

More and more African fintechs are diversifying their products and services to capture a bigger chunk of the global remittance market, majorly with the goal of enhancing the ability of the African diaspora to send money directly to their families quickly, securely, and more affordably.

The large gap left unattended by bank branches leaves a large market for remittance apps to capture, and they have been capturing it quite well. Since 2011, the rate of adults owning a financial account in sub-Saharan Africa has more than doubled, as about half of the population now owns an account.

Established in 2006 at the United Nation's International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Financing Facility for Remittances (FFR) is a multi-donor facility. The FFR finances and supports projects that spur innovation and improvements to global and domestic remittance markets with a focus on maximizing the development impact of migrant financial contributions to their families and communities that receive them, particularly in rural areas.

The cost to send money to Kenya remains high. The current average cost of sending US$200 to Kenya is 9.15 per cent of the amount sent (World Bank Q4 2023). Sending money to some African countries, such as Angola, Botswana and Namibia, can sometimes cost as high as 20 per cent of the amount transferred.

## DOCUMENT 38: INSTANT PAYMENTS REAL-TIME CROSS-BORDER AFRICA

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.citigroup.com/global/insights/the-future-of-cross-border-payments-in-africa
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Opportunities/Payment Infrastructure
**REGION:** Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Africa's cross-border payments market is on track to more than triple over the next ten years, from about $329 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion in 2035, according to a report by Oui Capital. The report estimates a compound annual growth rate of 12% for the period.

While 90 percent of payments on Swift's network reach their destination within the hour, the proportion of end-to-end transactions settling within that time is much less, because of issues in the last mile. At the heart of the issue is the so-called last mile — the final stretch of a cross-border payment that too often bottlenecks due to incompatible financial systems, basic errors in payment data, or regulatory divergence between countries.

Swift GPI lets you make high-speed cross-border payments in minutes or seconds. Nearly 60% of Swift GPI payments are credited to end beneficiaries within 30 minutes and almost 100% within 24 hours.

The Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) will allow instant cross-border payments in local currencies. Meanwhile, the African Continental Free Trade Area aims to harmonize financial systems across the region, which would reduce the need for international intermediaries like SWIFT and help lower costs further.

In November 2025, Rwanda and Tanzania commenced bi-lateral discussions to link their national retail payment systems switches, marking a crucial step toward enabling instant, low-cost cross-border money transfers. This initiative will connect Tanzania's Instant Payment System (TIPS) with Rwanda's National Payment Switch (RSWITCH). Once operational, the linkage will allow individuals and businesses in both countries to send and receive money between bank accounts and mobile money wallets seamlessly and in real time.

Fintech startups are playing a major role in cutting transaction costs. For small businesses and freelancers, these companies offer services that reduce fees by up to 90%. Blockchain-based solutions are going a step further, bringing transaction costs close to zero.

A U.S. fintech can pay gig workers in Kenya to M-Pesa wallets in seconds, and an e-commerce platform can settle instantly with sellers in Brazil via PIX, through single API connections powered by real-time connectivity.

"Africa can never be approached with a blanket solution," notes an Onafriq executive. "What works in Kenya will not work in South Africa. Kenya is defined by mobile money; South Africa is defined by cards and neobanks. Uganda is still heavily cash-driven."

"The infrastructure is there. Now we need to make it interoperable," said Olivier Lens, head of Sub-Saharan Africa for Swift.

## DOCUMENT 39: WEST AFRICA CAMEROON BENIN TOGO REMITTANCES

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.un.org/osaa/sites/www.un.org.osaa/files/files/documents/2024/publications/23343_un_policypaper_remittanceswestafrica_v04.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/West Africa Corridors
**REGION:** West Africa (Cameroon, Benin, Togo)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
As of mid-year 2020, 64 per cent of migrants from Western Africa lived in another country in the region, down from 80 per cent as of mid-year 1990. Over 90 per cent of migrants from Niger and over 75 per cent of migrants from Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, and Togo live in another country in Western Africa.

UN data show that 2 out of 3 migrants from West African countries migrate within the region and about 90% of the 7.4 million international migrants in West Africa are migrants from West African countries.

Western African countries received 27 billion USD in remittances in 2020. Nigeria, the largest recipient in Sub-Saharan Africa in absolute terms, received nearly 64 per cent of this total (17.2 billion), while the Gambia (15.6 per cent) and Cabo Verde (13.9 per cent) received the most remittances as a share of GDP.

In just over a decade, remittance inflows to Africa have surged from approximately US$53 billion in 2010 to roughly US$95 billion in 2024. This reflects an increase in their share of the continent's GDP from 3.6% to 5.1% over the same period.

Remittance flows in 2022 in West Africa demonstrated a significant pattern and resilience, with Nigeria being the primary recipient of almost $21 billion, accounting for over 60 per cent of the subregion's inflows.

Remittance prices fell from 9.8 per cent in Q2 2016 to 8.2 per cent in Q1 2025. At this rate of progress Africa will fail to meet SDG 10.c which states that remittance prices will not average more than 3 percent by 2030 and no single corridor will be more than 5 percent.

In Q1 2025 it cost 8.9 per cent to send to Southern Africa compared to 9.9 per cent to send to East Africa and 5.9 per cent in West Africa. There are currently four countries in Africa that are publishing remittance data broken down by corridor; these are Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco and Senegal.

In Benin, for example, among Togolese immigrants women are twice as numerous as men. Remittances sent from the top ECOWAS countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Niger, and Togo) exceed those sent from the top OECD countries.

As of October 2020, over 1 million people were internally displaced in Cameroon due to crises in the Lake Chad Basin area and the North-West South-West regions. Burkina Faso migrants have destinations including countries in Africa such as Angola, Algeria, Benin, Cameroon, Congo Brazzaville, The Gambia, Guinea Conakry, Niger, Nigeria, and Togo.

Remittance transfers sometimes exceed Official Development Aid (ODA) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in some parts of the World such as Sub-Saharan Africa, demonstrating their importance for promoting socio-economic development.

The AfCFTA Protocol on Digital Trade and cross-border payment systems like Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) offer a framework for harmonising rules, lowering costs and expanding formal remittance corridors.

## DOCUMENT 40: ETHIOPIA REMITTANCES DIASPORA GULF STATES

**SOURCE_URL:** https://kflip.info/2023/02/09/overview-of-ethiopias-remittance-market/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Diaspora/Gulf States
**REGION:** Ethiopia
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Ethiopia's latest remittance value from 2023 is 539.36 million U.S. dollars, an increase from 510.2 million U.S. dollars in 2022. Remittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to have increased by about 1.9% in 2023 to $54 billion, driven by strong remittance growth in Mozambique (48.5%), Rwanda (16.8%), and Ethiopia (16%).

Ethiopia has a sizable diaspora community, with some estimates putting the figure at over 870,000. Other sources estimate that approximately 2.5 million Ethiopians live in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Australia, and Africa.

Approximately 2.5 million sub-Saharan African immigrants lived in the United States in 2024—more than triple the number in 2000—with most coming from Nigeria, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, or South Africa.

Despite data discrepancies between sources, both the National Bank of Ethiopia and World Bank data show that the United States and Saudi Arabia are among Ethiopia's top five send markets.

It is estimated that 60-70 per cent of migrants travelling to Gulf States are undocumented, and this figure may be greater for migrants travelling to Southern Africa.

The Ethiopian government has sought to support the Ethiopian diaspora in the Middle East, who are mostly migrant labourers. After an initial ban on Ethiopian migration to Gulf States in 2013, following large-scale deportations of undocumented Ethiopian migrants from Saudi Arabia, the government introduced the Ethiopian Overseas Employment Proclamation No.923/2016 which specifies that migrants may only travel to work in countries where Ethiopia has concluded a bilateral labour agreement, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan.

Ethiopian diaspora in Gulf states have limited rights as labour migrants, giving the diaspora a limited voice.

The High Level Diaspora Diplomacy Consultative Forum was established in January 2024. This Consultative Forum comprises 300 members from 25 countries and is expected to engage the diaspora in diplomatic efforts and strengthen their active participation in overall development efforts.

In 2024, according to the World Bank, over $96.4 billion flowed into Africa in remittances, which is approximately twice the level of overseas development assistance. Remittances provide a lifeline for many families and countries, especially in rural areas where they can make the biggest difference.

Ethiopia is one of only four countries in Africa (along with Kenya, Morocco, and Senegal) that publish remittance data broken down by corridor.

## DOCUMENT 41: SOUTH AFRICA REMITTANCE MARKET DYNAMICS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.resbank.co.za/content/dam/sarb/what-we-do/payments-and-settlements/cross-border-payments-conference/documents/paper-migration-cross-border-payments.pdf
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Corridors/Remittances/Regional Hub
**REGION:** Southern Africa (South Africa)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Approximately one-fifth of total remittances to Africa stems from transfers within Africa. In 2023, this accounted for about US$20 billion of remittances originating from within Africa.

The South Africa to Zimbabwe corridor has emerged as the largest inbound remittance route in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. Zimbabwean migrants record the highest share of those remitting, at 59%, which stands noticeably above the SADC average of 56%.

The data also indicate that Zimbabweans (49%) are more likely to send funds once a month.

South Africa remains the most significant destination country in Africa, with around 2.9 million international migrants. Countries like South Africa, Gabon, Nigeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Algeria, Morocco, South Sudan, Sudan, and Djibouti are labor magnets due to their relatively higher wages, which attract many nationals from neighboring countries.

The South African remittance market is witnessing a surge in digital payment solutions, with over 50% of transactions now conducted online. Innovations such as mobile wallets and peer-to-peer transfer platforms have simplified cross-border transactions.

In Q1 2024, South Africa (7.08 percent) is the most expensive country in the G20 group to remit to, followed by China (6.61 percent).

## DOCUMENT 42: NIGER TRANSIT MIGRATION REMITTANCES

**SOURCE_URL:** https://migrants-refugees.va/country-profile/niger/
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Corridors/Transit Migration
**REGION:** West Africa (Niger)
**CERTAINTY:** Medium

**CONTENT:**
Niger is positioned at the crossroads of the migratory routes of West and Central Africa. Thus, Niger has become one of the main transit countries for migrants originating from West and Central Africa, moving to North Africa, and migrating irregularly across the Mediterranean.

The majority of emigrants from Niger find themselves in Nigeria (37.8%), Libya (12.6%), Côte d'Ivoire (12.4%), Benin (8.3%), Ghana (7.7%), Togo (5.2%), and Cameroon (3.5%).

Remittances originating from Africa to Nigeria account for 12.7% of total inflows, with the top six originating countries being Cameroon (23.4%), Ghana (17.2%), Togo (16.8%), South Africa (13.3%), Benin (8.6%) and Niger (5.6%).

Labour migration in West Africa takes many forms, including temporary, seasonal and permanent migration, and implicates many sectors of employment, such as mining in Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal.

Every year, thousands of seasonal workers from West and Central Africa travel to gold mining areas in Burkina Faso, Senegal, or Mali.

## DOCUMENT 43: GAMBIA CABO VERDE HIGH REMITTANCE DEPENDENCY

**SOURCE_URL:** https://www.migrationdataportal.org/regional-data-overview/western-africa
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/High GDP Share
**REGION:** West Africa (Gambia, Cabo Verde)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The Gambia depends on remittances for over 21% of its GDP. Lesotho and Comoros also sit near the top of the list, with remittances making up around 20% of their economies.

Western African countries received 27 billion USD in remittances in 2020. Nigeria, the largest recipient in Sub-Saharan Africa in absolute terms, received nearly 64 per cent of this total (17.2 billion), while the Gambia (15.6 per cent) and Cabo Verde (13.9 per cent) received the most remittances as a share of GDP.

In some cases remittances represent more than 7% of the country's GDP. In three countries, this percentage is much higher: Liberia (20.4%), The Gambia (15.4%), and Senegal (11.4%).

The distribution of fintech innovation across the continent tells a paradoxical story: countries most dependent on remittances receive the least startup attention. New entrants face formidable competition from well-capitalized incumbents.

One in nine people on earth are affected by remittance flows. Roughly half reside in small towns and rural villages where remittances put food on the table, educate children, and support small businesses.

## DOCUMENT 44: MOZAMBIQUE REMITTANCE TRENDS

**SOURCE_URL:** https://sihma.org.za/african-migration-statistics/country/mozambique
**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Remittances/Trends
**REGION:** Southern Africa (Mozambique)
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
Mozambique is ranked one of the top five countries that supply migrant labour to South Africa. As a result, remittance flow between South Africa and Mozambique constitutes one of the top four remittance corridors within the SADC region.

According to the World Bank, Mozambique has enjoyed a steady increase in its remittances received from $93,372,690 in 2016 to $453,972,066 in 2021. As a percentage of GDP, remittance flow increased from 0.8% in 2016 to 2.8% in 2021 and dropped to 1.6% in 2022.

Remittance flows to Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to have increased by about 1.9% in 2023 to $54 billion, driven by strong remittance growth in Mozambique (48.5%), Rwanda (16.8%), and Ethiopia (16%).

The marginal cost of sending USD200 from South Africa to Mozambique has decreased from 21.76 percent in Q3 2014 to 9.7 percent a decade later.

IFAD is partnering with Mama Money under the PRIME Africa initiative to maximize the impact of remittances sent by low-income migrants in South Africa to their remittance receiving families in Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

Discussions highlighted the use of 'grey' remittance channels that blend formal infrastructure with informal practices, particularly within the Mozambican corridor.

**RETRIEVED:** 2025-12-03
**CATEGORY:** Opportunities/Regional Integration
**REGION:** Pan-African
**CERTAINTY:** High

**CONTENT:**
The AfCFTA Protocol on Digital Trade and cross-border payment systems like Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) offer a framework for harmonising rules, lowering costs and expanding formal remittance corridors.

Remittance transfers sometimes exceed Official Development Aid (ODA) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in some parts of the World such as Sub-Saharan Africa, demonstrating their importance for promoting socio-economic development.

In just over a decade, remittance inflows to Africa have surged from approximately US$53 billion in 2010 to roughly US$95 billion in 2024. This reflects an increase in their share of the continent's GDP from 3.6% to 5.1% over the same period.

Remittance prices fell from 9.8 per cent in Q2 2016 to 8.2 per cent in Q1 2025, a drop of 1.6 percentage points. At this rate of progress Africa will fail to meet SDG 10.c which states that remittance prices will not average more than 3 percent by 2030 and no single corridor will be more than 5 percent.

The regulation of domestic infrastructure, the introduction of national switches, and their integration are essential. Countries must connect national switches, such as Tanzania's TIPS and Rwanda's RSwitch, to PAPSS and standardize AML/KYC regulations to improve interoperable digital infrastructure and promote local currency settlement.
