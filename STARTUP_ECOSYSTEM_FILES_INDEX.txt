CONVERSATION STARTERS (By Founder Role)
================================================================================

M&A Advisor / Corporate Development:
"Deal looks good on paper, but cross-domain conflicts hide in appendices.
Want to see how IF.arbitrate surfaces them upfront?"

Supply Chain Executive:
"Your supply chain is your moat and your risk. Most do status quo analysis.
Want to model geopolitical disruption scenarios?"

Operations / Manufacturing:
"Sophisticated fraud slips through when sources are individually authentic
but collectively inconsistent. Want to see IF.verify in action?"

CEO in Crisis:
"You need analysis in 2 hours. Want to see how Speed Demon delivers
confident recommendations in 25 minutes instead of 80?"

Venture Capitalist / Angel Investor:
"Standard DD focuses on credentials. Want to see founder retention patterns
that predict success 5 years later?"
