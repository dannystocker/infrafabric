## RISK MITIGATION

### What Could Go Wrong

**Risk 1: He says no to partnership**
- Mitigation: Value in demo alone (improves his positioning)
- Fallback: Open-source positioning (help industry, build reputation)

**Risk 2: Test #2 fails (speedup not 140×)**
- Mitigation: Conservative estimate in report (70% savings still valuable)
- Fallback: Adjust claims, focus on governance + cost reduction

**Risk 3: His clients don't adopt**
- Mitigation: 14-day pilot proves value before commitment
- Fallback: Adjust implementation approach, try different client segment

**Risk 4: Competitor launches similar solution**
- Mitigation: First-mover advantage with Georges (his clients first)
- Fallback: Differentiation through governance layer (most defensible)

### Confidence Level

**Overall Confidence: HIGH** (7.5/10)

**High Confidence Factors:**
- ✅ Research quality (85% completeness)
- ✅ Profile accuracy (multiple validation sources)
- ✅ Market positioning (clear differentiation)
- ✅ Evidence quality (test results solid)
- ✅ Partnership fit (6/6 criteria met)

**Medium Confidence Factors:**
- ⏳ Test #2 results (in progress, due Dec 6)
- ⏳ Test #5 market validation (in progress, due Dec 3)
- ⏳ His actual revenue requirement (inferred, not stated)
- ⏳ Client adoption rate (projected, not historical)

**What Would Increase Confidence:**
- Complete Test #2 (performance validation)
- Complete Test #5 (market feedback)
- Get Gemini synthesis/improvement recommendations
- Soft validation call with Georges (gauge interest)
