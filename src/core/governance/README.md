# Governance Logic Recovery

Requested `if_*` function definitions (e.g., if_ground, if_search) were not present in the cleaned archive `infrafabric-all-branches-cleaned.tar.gz`. Branch manifests indicate they exist in `claude/sip-escalate-integration-011CV2nwLukS7EtnB5iZUUe7`, but only metadata was packaged.

Action items:
- Recover actual python sources for `if_*` functions from the full git history or uncleaned archive.
- Once obtained, place them here under governance/ and wire to IF.logistics/Packet envelopes.
