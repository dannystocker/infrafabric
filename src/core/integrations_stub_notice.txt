No adapter sources were present in the cleaned backup for:
- sip_h323_gateway.py
- vmix_adapter.py
- ndi_sip_bridge.py
Manifests in the archive referenced these files under branches:
- claude/sip-escalate-integration-011CV2nwLukS7EtnB5iZUUe7
- claude/if-bus-sip-adapters-011CV2yyTqo7mStA7KhuUszV
- claude/cloud-providers-011CV2nnsyHT4by1am1ZrkkA
But the cleaned tarball did not include their contents. Placeholders are created under src/integrations/broadcast/ with TODOs.
