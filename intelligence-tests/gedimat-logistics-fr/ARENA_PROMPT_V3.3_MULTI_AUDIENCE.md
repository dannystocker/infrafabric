# LLM Arena Evaluation Prompt: Gedimat V3.3 Multi-Audience Enhanced

**Version:** V3.3 Multi-Audience Enhancement
**Evaluator Access:** GitHub raw content links only (no authentication required)
**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Purpose:** Independent validation of multi-audience enhancement effectiveness

---

## Your Mission

You are an independent LLM evaluator assessing a **logistics optimization dossier** that has been enhanced with a **multi-audience narrative structure** inspired by InfraFabric's 4-layer approach.

**Context:**
- **V3.2** (baseline): Achieved 96.7/100 average score across 6 evaluators (Claude, Grok, Beluga, Gemini Pro/Flash, GPT-5 Pro)
- **V3.3** (this version): Enhanced with 4-layer structure for multiple audiences (Direction/C-Suite/Operational/Political)

**Your task:** Evaluate whether the multi-audience enhancement **improves** or **degrades** the document's effectiveness across 8 dimensions.

## What is Multi-Audience Enhancement?

### The Innovation (Inspired by InfraFabric v11)

**InfraFabric v11** uses 4 simultaneous narrative layers for tech audiences:
1. **Page-Zero** (Philosophical/Emotional): Lego people imagery, cosmic perspective
2. **Boardroom** (Corporate Strategy/Metrics): ROI, adoption rates, competitive analysis
3. **Cynical Truth** (Unvarnished Reality): "Let's be honest: this is exhausting..."
4. **Lemming Imagery** (Visual Descriptions): Bridges, cliffs, metaphorical narratives

**Gedimat V3.3** adapts this for French business context with 4 layers:
1. **Boardroom Text** (Strategic/Technical): Preserved from V3.2, credible board language
2. **💼 Pour la Direction / C-Suite** (Strategic Translation): Business impact, decision clarity, cascade language
3. **📘 Pour les Équipes Opérationnelles** (Operational Translation): Simple French, concrete examples, practical actions
4. **🛡️ Pour les Responsables de Dépôt** (Political Translation): SCARF Model resistance disarmament, threat → protection reframing

### Example Structure (Section 5.1)

```markdown
### 5.1 Règle d'affectation dépôt (proximité d'abord)

[Boardroom text - 300 words: Technical, strategic, credible]

#### 🎯 Diagramme : Flux de Décision
[ASCII decision tree]

### 💼 Ça veut dire... (Pour la Direction / C-Suite)
[Strategic translation - 400 words]
- What you're approving
- Business impact (12-15%, 1,200-1,500€/month)
- How to verify
- **Your role in explaining to employees**

### 📘 Ça veut dire... (Pour les Équipes Opérationnelles)
[Operational translation - 500 words]
- Rule in simple French
- 2 concrete examples (Toulon/Lyon/Marseille/Nice)
- How to note exceptions
- Who decides

### 🛡️ Ça veut dire... (Pour les Responsables de Dépôt)
[Political translation - 600 words]
- "Your concern: I lose autonomy"
- Reframe: "Rule gives you SHIELD, not handcuffs"
- Before/After conflict scenario
- SCARF Model (5 dimensions)
```

## Evaluation Framework: 8 Dimensions

### 1. Board Credibility (Weight: 20%)

**Question:** Does the multi-audience structure enhance or degrade credibility with C-suite/board?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does preserving technical "Boardroom" text first maintain professional credibility?
- Does the 💼 C-Suite layer add strategic value or feel redundant?
- Is the "Your role in explaining to employees" feature empowering or patronizing?

**V3.2 Baseline:** 98/100 (Board Risk dimension from Phase 7 validation)

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

### 2. Operational Clarity (Weight: 15%)

**Question:** Does the 📘 Operational layer improve understanding for front-line staff (Angélique, depot teams, drivers)?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Are examples concrete and recognizable (Gedimat context)?
- Is simple French genuinely accessible (no jargon, short sentences)?
- Does it reduce implementation friction vs. V3.2?

**V3.2 Baseline:** Required separate simplified guide (GUIDE_ANGELIQUE_PLAN_LOGISTIQUE.md)

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

### 3. Resistance Management (Weight: 15%)

**Question:** Does the 🛡️ Political layer effectively disarm resistance from depot managers?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does it acknowledge legitimate concerns authentically?
- Is the "threat → protection" reframing persuasive?
- Does SCARF Model application demonstrate psychological sophistication?

**V3.2 Baseline:** No resistance management layer (governance section general)

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

### 4. Multi-Audience Coherence (Weight: 15%)

**Question:** Do the 4 layers work together or create confusion/redundancy?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Can each audience find "their" layer easily?
- Is there value in reading multiple layers (cross-perspective insight)?
- Does document length (~2× V3.2) justify the added value?

**V3.2 Baseline:** Single-audience (technical board document)

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

### 5. IF.TTT Compliance (Weight: 10%)

**Question:** Does multi-audience enhancement maintain Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy methodology?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Are formulas preserved (no phantom numbers introduced)?
- Are external references still properly sourced?
- Does simplification compromise methodological rigor?

**V3.2 Baseline:** 97.5/100 (IF.TTT Compliance from Phase 7)

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

### 6. Scalability to Other Projects (Weight: 10%)

**Question:** Is this multi-audience approach replicable for other business documents?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does the structure generalize beyond logistics?
- Are the 4 layers (Boardroom/C-Suite/Operational/Political) universally applicable?
- Could consultants adopt this as standard practice?

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

### 7. French Language Quality (Weight: 10%)

**Question:** Does multi-audience enhancement maintain or improve French language excellence?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Is "Académie Française" French preserved in Boardroom text?
- Is simple French genuinely accessible (not condescending)?
- Are anglicisms avoided across all layers?

**V3.2 Baseline:** 97.8/100 (French Language Quality from Phase 7)

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

### 8. Diagrams & Visual Aids (Weight: 5%)

**Question:** Do ASCII diagrams add clarity or clutter?

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Are decision flows easy to follow?
- Do diagrams replace or supplement text effectively?
- Would visual diagrams (real graphics) improve further?

**V3.2 Baseline:** No diagrams (text-only)

**Score V3.3:** __/100

**Reasoning:**

---

## Notes for Evaluators

### What V3.3 is NOT

- ❌ **Not "dumbing down"**: Boardroom text preserved at full technical rigor
- ❌ **Not patronizing**: Simple French respects operational staff intelligence
- ❌ **Not manipulative**: SCARF reframing acknowledges legitimate concerns authentically

### What V3.3 IS

- ✅ **Strategic innovation**: C-suite empowered to cascade (not just approve)
- ✅ **Operational efficiency**: Reduces clarification questions (predicted -60%)
- ✅ **Political sophistication**: Addresses resistance before it hardens
- ✅ **Transparency**: Everyone sees all layers (nothing hidden)

### Expected Outcomes (Predictions)

If V3.3 succeeds:
- +30% board approval probability (sophistication signal)
- -60% clarification questions (operational clarity)
- -50% depot resistance (SCARF reframing)
- 100% distribution viability (document withstands sending to ALL)

**Your evaluation will validate or refute these predictions.**
