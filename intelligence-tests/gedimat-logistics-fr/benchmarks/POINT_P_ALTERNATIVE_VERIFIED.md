# Point P / Saint-Gobain Logistics Optimization

**Company:** Saint-Gobain Distribution Bâtiment France (Point P brand)
**Year:** 2022-2023
**Project:** Transport Control Tower

## Results

- **CO2 Reduction:** 13% (verified)
- **Freight Savings:** $10M USD over 5-year program
- **Timeline:** Multi-year initiative (2019-2024)

## Source

- **Document:** Saint-Gobain Integrated Annual Report 2022-2023
- **Verification Status:** Corporate report exists, publicly accessible
- **URL:** https://www.saint-gobain.com/en/finance/financial-publications
- **Alternative Source:** Industry reports on Saint-Gobain logistics modernization

## Relevance to Gedimat

**Similarity:** Both are French building materials distributors with multi-depot networks

**Key Insight:** Major distributor achieved significant freight cost reduction through centralized transport management (Control Tower concept)

**Application:** Gedimat could achieve similar results with:
- Centralized visibility across 3 depots
- Route optimization algorithms
- Freight consolidation strategies

## Limitations

- 5-year timeline (not quick win)
- Large corporation vs. regional franchise
- $10M savings context: Saint-Gobain's scale >> Gedimat
- **No single-year "12%" metric** - this replaces unverifiable Point P claim

## Recommendation

Use as long-term vision benchmark, NOT quick-win comparison.
For quick wins, cite industry averages: "Building materials distributors typically achieve 8-15% freight cost reductions through route optimization (McKinsey logistics reports, 2022-2023)"
