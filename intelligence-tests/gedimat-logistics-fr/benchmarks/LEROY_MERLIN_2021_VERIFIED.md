## ROI Calculation (If Gedimat Wants to Estimate)

**Conservative approach:**
- Assume 11% logistics cost reduction (Leroy Merlin's storage metric)
- Gedimat baseline: €[Fill from Médiafret invoices]
- Savings: €baseline × 11% = €[calculated]
- Investment: €30,000-€50,000 (WMS implementation for Gedimat scale)
- ROI: €savings / €investment = [Gedimat calculates]

**Note:** This is NOT claiming "8.5×" - Gedimat must calculate with THEIR data

## Relevance to Gedimat

- Both French retail/distribution
- Both omnichannel (stores + e-commerce)
- Automation reduced preparation costs (relevant for Gedimat picking)

## Limitations

- Leroy Merlin scale >> Gedimat
- €40M investment not applicable to Gedimat
- Warehouse automation vs. Gedimat's transport optimization focus
