**Company:** Kingfisher plc (owns Castorama, B&Q, Screwfix, Brico Dépôt)
**Year:** FY2023 (2022/23)
**Metric:** Group-level NPS and Customer Satisfaction

## Verified Metrics

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- **Kingfisher Group NPS:** ~50 (FY2023)
- **Target:** 60 (FY2024)
- **Source:** Kingfisher Annual Report 2023/24
- **URL:** https://www.kingfisher.com/content/dam/kingfisher/Corporate/Documents/Other/2024/Kingfisher-Annual-Report-202324.pdf

### Customer Satisfaction
- **Overall Satisfaction Score:** 82% (FY2023)
- **Source:** Kingfisher Annual Report 2023/24

## What Changed from V2

**V2 Claim (UNVERIFIABLE):** "Castorama 2023 NPS 47, Source: Kingfisher RSE Report + Internal Analytics"
- **Problem:** "Internal Analytics" is not a public, verifiable source
- **Problem:** Kingfisher does NOT disclose Castorama-specific NPS publicly

**V3 Reality (VERIFIED):** Kingfisher GROUP data (Castorama is one brand within group)
- NPS 50 at group level (includes all Kingfisher brands)
- Customer satisfaction 82% (group-wide)
- Castorama-specific metrics: NOT publicly disclosed

## Relevance to Gedimat

**Limited relevance:**
- Castorama = DIY retail (B2C focus)
- Gedimat = Building materials distribution (B2B focus)
- NPS measurement approaches differ (B2C vs. B2B)

**Better alternative benchmarks for Gedimat:**
- Point P (direct competitor, B2B building materials)
- Other négoce matériaux competitors
- Industry average NPS for B2B distribution

## Recommendation for V3

**REMOVE Castorama benchmark** - not relevant to B2B Gedimat context

**REPLACE with:**
1. Industry average B2B NPS (if available)
2. Gedimat's own NPS measurement (data collection form provided)
3. Generic B2B distribution NPS range (40-60 typical for French B2B)
