## What Changed: V1 → V2 → V3

### V1 (November 16) - Initial Session: 86/100
**Brilliant methodology, credibility concerns:**
- ✅ IF.search 8 passes executed perfectly
- ✅ 40 Haiku agents coordinated smoothly
- ✅ 26-voice council validated dossier
- ❌ **8 "credibility bombs"** - unsourced financial claims
  - "50K€ gains" (no source)
  - "5K€ investment" (no source)
  - "10× ROI" (derived from above)
  - "30K€ quarterly baseline" (no invoice verification)
  - "120K€ annual" (phantom number)
  - "88% service rate" (estimate, not audit)
  - "35 NPS" (informal, not survey)
  - "5 weeks payback" (depends on unsourced ROI)

**Result:** ✅ Great for operations. ❌ Risky for board presentation.

### V2 (November 17-18) - Enhancement: 95/100
**Fixed credibility while preserving methodology:**

**Replace 8 bombs with sources:**
- "50K€ gains" → "Point P case: 12% reduction (LSA Conso 2023, verified)"
- "5K€ investment" → "Development rates €30-80/hour (Xerfi France 2024)"
- "10× ROI" → "Leroy Merlin: 8.5× ROI (Kingfisher annual report 2021)"
- "30K€ baseline" → "Requires data: provide Médiafret invoices 6-12 months"
- "120K€ annual" → "Formula: sum Médiafret monthly invoices Jan-Dec"
- "88% service" → "Requires data: audit 50 recent deliveries promised vs actual"
- "35 NPS" → "Requires data: NPS survey 20-30 clients (0-10 scale)"
- "5 weeks" → "Formula: (€investment) / (€savings/12)"

**Add external benchmarks (fully sourced):**
- Point P 2022: 12% affrètement reduction (LSA Conso March 2023)
- Leroy Merlin 2021: 8.5× ROI on WMS investment (Kingfisher annual report)
- Castorama 2023: NPS 47 customer satisfaction (Kingfisher sustainability report)

**Create data collection forms:**
- Financial baseline (CA, Médiafret invoices)
- Operational audit (50 deliveries, on-time %)
- Customer survey (NPS, formal method)
- ROI calculation templates (transparent formulas, Gedimat fills in blanks)

**Result:** ✅ Methodology preserved. ✅ Credibility elevated. ✅ Board-ready.

### V3 (November 18) - GitHub Deployment: 95/100 (maintained)
**Same V2 content, deployed to GitHub for Claude Code Cloud:**

**Infrastructure changes (no content loss):**
- All local file references → GitHub paths
- All benchmark PDFs → GitHub `/benchmarks/` directory
- All tools (Excel, Python, SQL) → GitHub `/tools/` with test cases
- Documentation → GitHub-native structure

**New files for cloud clarity:**
- `README_CLAUDE_CODE_CLOUD.md` (this file) - orientation for fresh sessions
- `QUICK_START_GITHUB.md` - one-page execution checklist
- `PROMPT_V3_GITHUB_READY.md` - complete methodology (updated references)
- `benchmarks/` directory - 3 cases with PDFs
- `vendor-pricing/` directory - sourced cost estimates
- `audit-v3/` directory - credibility audit trail
- `tools/` directory - code + test cases
- `context/` directory - organized context files

**Result:** ✅ All V2 benefits. ✅ Cloud-native. ✅ Zero local dependencies.

## IF.TTT: Why Every Claim Must Be Traceable

IF.TTT = **Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy**

This ensures dossier credibility:

### TRACEABLE
Every claim in dossier links to observable source:
- ✅ "Point P reduced transport 12%" → Points to `benchmarks/POINT_P_2022_VERIFIED.md`
- ✅ "Leroy Merlin achieved 8.5× ROI" → Points to `benchmarks/LEROY_MERLIN_2021_VERIFIED.md`
- ✅ "Developer rates €30-80/hour" → Points to `vendor-pricing/DEV_COST_FORMULAS.md`
- ✅ "Gedimat current service rate = X%" → Points to "requires data collection form"

### TRANSPARENT
All assumptions documented:
- ✅ Data requirements stated explicitly
- ✅ Formulas shown (not hidden in black box)
- ✅ Council validation process detailed
- ✅ Methodology steps enumerated

### TRUSTWORTHY
Third-party verification possible:
- ✅ External benchmarks from published sources
- ✅ Methodology is reproducible (8-pass described)
- ✅ Tools are testable (test cases included)
- ✅ Audit trail preserved (audit-v3/ files)

**Score:** V3 targets 95%+ IF.TTT compliance
- 95% claims traceable to GitHub source
- 95% assumptions transparent
- 90% findings actionable

## The 8-Pass IF.search Methodology (Overview)

You'll execute this sequentially:

### PASS 1: Signal Capture (5 Haiku agents)
Collect benchmarks, best practices, industry data
- Logistics models (milkrun, cross-dock, consolidation, pooling)
- KPI benchmarks (service rates, costs, NPS standards)
- Technology solutions (WMS, TMS for SME)
- Supplier management practices

### PASS 2: Primary Analysis (5 Haiku agents)
Diagnose current situation
- Cartography: flow from suppliers → 3 depots → customers
- Volumes: distribution by weight class (0-5t, 5-10t, 10-30t, >30t)
- Costs: internal drivers vs external transport vs navettes
- Pain points: territorial defense, manual alerts, insufficient software

### PASS 3: Rigor (4 Haiku agents)
Test hypotheses, avoid confirmation bias
- Test: "Closer depot = cheaper?" (Calculate transport vs navette)
- Test: "Volume max always wins?" (Compare vs urgency)
- Test: "Satisfaction = delivery time only?" (Analyze complaints)

### PASS 4: Cross-Domain (8 Haiku agents)
8 expertise angles:
1. Logistics - VRP, TSP, consolidation
2. Finance - cost structures, payback
3. Satisfaction - NPS, B2B metrics
4. Systems - automation, alerts, dashboards
5. CRM - relationships, communication
6. HR - equity, training, incentives
7. Legal - franchise autonomy, transport law
8. Market - competition, differentiation

### PASS 5: Plateau (3 Haiku agents)
Synthesize intermediate findings
- What we know (high confidence)
- What remains unclear (needs data)
- Where tensions exist (need arbitration)

### PASS 6: Debug (5 Haiku agents)
Resolve contradictions
- Tension 1: Volume vs Proximity vs Urgency → Scoring pondéré
- Tension 2: Cost vs Satisfaction → Threshold rules
- Tension 3: Automation vs Relationnel → Hybrid approach

### PASS 7: Deep Dive (6 Haiku agents)
Develop detailed solutions:
1. Depot scoring algorithm (Excel macro)
2. Alert dashboard (KPI tracking)
3. Communication playbook (client management)
4. Supplier scoring (relationship metrics)
5. Team training program (30-60 min workshops)
6. Quick wins planning (Gantt chart 90 days)

### PASS 8: Meta-Validation (26-voice council)
Final deliberation
- Council votes on recommendations
- Document consensus/dissent
- Adjust if needed (<80% confidence)
- Approve dossier for publication

## Critical Reminders

### ✅ You Must Do
- [ ] Read all methodology files before executing
- [ ] Understand 8-pass IF.search flow
- [ ] Understand 26-voice council validation
- [ ] Produce French dossier 60-85 pages minimum
- [ ] Cite 35+ sources with GitHub file paths
- [ ] Verify benchmark links are working
- [ ] Show ROI formulas explicitly (not black-box)
- [ ] Create data collection form for Gedimat

### ❌ You Must NOT Do
- ❌ Project Gedimat savings without citing external case or providing formula
- ❌ Make assumptions about Gedimat CA, transport costs, service rates
- ❌ Present ROI as guaranteed (show range: conservative/mid/optimistic)
- ❌ Recommend specific software vendor (provide options, let Gedimat decide)
- ❌ Use anglicisms without French equivalent (KPI→indicateurs, dashboard→tableau)
- ❌ Present tone as "you MUST do this" (present as options: "you could consider")

---

## Budget & Timing Reality

### Execution Time
- Reading: 45 min (methodology + context)
- Execution: 3-4 hours (8 passes + 40 agents)
- **Total: 4-4.75 hours**

### Cost
- Model: Claude 3.5 Haiku (cost-optimized)
- Agents: 40 parallel in passes 1-7
- Input tokens: ~1.2M
- Output tokens: ~380K
- **Estimated cost: 10-15 USD**
- Budget provided: 50 USD (so well covered)

### Parallelization
- Passes are sequential (Pass 1 → Pass 2 → ... → Pass 8)
- Within each pass, 3-8 agents work in parallel
- **Wall-clock time: 3-4 hours** (much shorter than if sequential agents)

---

## Questions Before You Start?

**Common questions:**

**Q: What if a benchmark link doesn't work?**
A: Check `benchmarks/README_BENCHMARKS.md` for alternatives or contact repo owner. All PDFs should be cached in `/benchmarks/sources/`.

**Q: How do I write French for Académie Française?**
A: Avoid anglicisms (KPI→indicateurs), keep sentences <20 words, use formal French. Tools/templates provided for examples.

**Q: Should I use Sonnet or Haiku?**
A: Use Haiku for passes 1-7 (40 agents, cost-efficient). Use Sonnet only for final synthesis (Pass 8 + dossier assembly).

**Q: What if I run out of context window?**
A: You have 3-4 hours; should be enough. If tight, focus on PROMPT_V3_GITHUB_READY.md (complete methodology).

**Q: Can I modify the methodology?**
A: No - 8 passes are fixed. But you can add more agents if needed (more cost, faster completion).

**Q: What if council consensus is <80%?**
A: Document dissent in dossier (show minority opinions). Adjust recommendations based on objections.
