## HOW TO USE THESE DOCUMENTS

### Scenario 1: Approve Enhancement This Week
**Action:** Run GEDIMAT_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT.md (add legal/academic sources)
**Timeline:** 3-4 hours Haiku agents
**Result:** 90/100 dossier with sources but still estimated Gedimat numbers
**Then:** Send GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM.md in parallel
**Final:** Merge results by 30 Nov → 95/100 ready for Board

**Files to use:**
- QUICK_REFERENCE for stakeholder briefing
- GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM to send to Gedimat
- AUDIT_SUMMARY for decision-maker explanation

---

### Scenario 2: Collect Gedimat Data First (Safer)
**Action:** Send GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM.md immediately
**Timeline:** Gedimat response 5-7 days, analysis 2 days
**Result:** 95/100 dossier with verified numbers from day one
**Then:** Run Enhancement in parallel for academic/legal sources
**Final:** Integrated 95/100 dossier ready for Board (5-10 Nov)

**Files to use:**
- QUICK_REFERENCE for initial Gedimat briefing
- GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM as main deliverable
- AUDIT_SUMMARY for PDG/Directeur conversation

---

### Scenario 3: Use Current Dossier As-Is (Operational)
**Action:** Keep 86/100 version for Angélique's daily use (tools are solid)
**Timeline:** Immediate
**Result:** Scoring spreadsheet, NPS template, communication scripts usable now
**Caveat:** Do NOT cite "50K€ savings" or "ROI 10×" in presentations
**Instead:** Use as operational guide while gathering data

**Files to use:**
- QUICK_REFERENCE to show limitations
- GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM for background data collection
- Keep current dossier for tool templates only

## CRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY

### What's Wrong (86/100 → 40/100 Financial Credibility)

| Claim | Status | Impact | Fix |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|
| 50K€ savings | NO SOURCE | Fatal (dossier credibility dies here) | Tie to Médiafret invoice data |
| 5K€ investment | NO SOURCE | ROI = garbage | Itemize actual costs |
| 10× ROI | DERIVED | Built on two unsourced numbers | Recalculate with real data |
| 3.3M€ CA | ASSUMED | Wrong math if real CA ≠ 3.3M€ | VERIFY with Gedimat |
| 30K€/quarter | NO SOURCE | Baseline for all improvements | Extract invoices Q1-Q3 |
| 88% service | ESTIMATED | Inferred, not measured | Audit 50 orders (30 days) |
| 35 NPS | INFORMAL | Not surveyed scientifically | Survey 20 clients properly |

### Why This Matters
If Gedimat PDG asks: "Where did you get these numbers?" and you say "estimated" or "benchmarks," he'll say: **"Show me YOUR invoices, not industry averages."**

The dossier is methodologically brilliant (86/100) but financially non-credible (40/100). Fixing requires real data, not more consultant estimates.

## TIMELINE OPTIONS

### Fast Track (Parallel Approach)
```
TODAY (16 Nov)
  ├─ Approve Enhancement execution → 90/100 by 23 Nov
  └─ Send data form to Gedimat → responses by 23 Nov
           ↓ (MERGE both)
BY 30 NOV
  └─ Final 95/100 dossier ready for Board presentation
```
Cost: ~8-12$ USD (Enhancement) + internal data collection
Timeline: 14 days
Risk: Medium (if Gedimat slow on data)

### Conservative Track (Data First)
```
TODAY (16 Nov)
  └─ Send data form to Gedimat → responses by 23 Nov
       ↓ (Analyze & recalculate)
BY 25 NOV
  └─ Produce 95/100 dossier with verified numbers
       ↓ (Parallel Enhancement optional)
BY 1 DEC
  └─ Final Board-ready version with all sources
```
Cost: 0$ (internal only) + ~5-8$ if Enhancement approved
Timeline: 15 days
Risk: Low (data-driven, defensible)

### Operational Track (Use Now)
```
TODAY (16 Nov)
  └─ Use 86/100 for Angélique's tools (scoring, NPS, communication)
  └─ Acknowledge limitations in any external communication
       ↓
LATER (Data collection background task)
BY JANUARY
  └─ Upgraded 95/100 ready for next Board review
```
Cost: 0$ now
Timeline: Operational immediately, strategically upgraded later
Risk: Zero (honest about current state)

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP

**DECISION REQUIRED:**

### Option A: Parallel (Fast, Integrated)
- Start Enhancement THIS WEEK
- Send data form THIS WEEK
- Merge results by 30 Nov → 95/100 ready

### Option B: Data First (Conservative, Defensible)
- Send data form THIS WEEK
- Wait for Gedimat response (5 days)
- Analyze (2 days)
- Generate 95/100 (3 days)
- Add Enhancement later if needed

### Option C: Operational Now (Humble, Honest)
- Use current dossier for operational tools only
- Collect data gradually
- Upgrade version in January when ready

**My recommendation:** Option A (Parallel)
- Leverage Enhancement Prompt momentum
- Gedimat data collection runs parallel
- Merge both streams by end of month
- Result: 95/100 fully defensible AND academically rigorous

## AUDIT CONCLUSION

**Current State:** 86/100 methodology, 40/100 financial credibility

**Primary Issues:** 8 critical unsourced financial claims (50K€, 5K€, 10×, baselines, assumptions)

**Solution:** Two-part approach:
1. Enhancement Pass 9 (add legal/academic sources) → 90/100
2. Gedimat data collection (verify financial numbers) → 95/100 when combined

**Timeline:** 14-21 days to full credibility

**Cost:** 8-12$ (Enhancement) + internal time (data collection)

**Risk Mitigation:** All 4 audit documents provide transparency, clear guidance, and defensible paths forward
