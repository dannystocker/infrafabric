# LLM Arena Review Prompt: Gedimat Logistics Dossier

**PASTE THIS INTO LLM ARENA AFTER UPLOADING THE MERGED DOSSIER**

---

## Review Request

I'm requesting a comprehensive review of a board-ready strategic dossier for Gedimat, a French building materials distributor. This is a real-world B2B logistics optimization project that uses a novel **IF.TTT methodology** (Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy) to prevent phantom numbers in consulting deliverables.

**Document:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dannystocker/infrafabric/gedimat-evidence-final/intelligence-tests/gedimat-logistics-fr/GEDIMAT_ARENA_REVIEW_COMPLETE.md

**Your task:** Evaluate this dossier as if YOU were the external consultant being asked to validate it before the PDG presents it to the board. Would you stake YOUR professional reputation on this?

---

## Context

**Client:** Gedimat (3 depots: Lieu, Méru, Breuilpont)
**Problem:** High external freight costs, manual coordination, frequent delays
**Solution:** Proximity-first depot assignment + internal shuttle redistribution + simple alerting system
**Audience:** C-suite executives (PDG, CFO, COO)
**Innovation:** Zero phantom numbers (all formulas + data requirements specified)

**Key Differentiator:** Integrated behavioral psychology framework (Rory Sutherland) to build long-term client loyalty, not just short-term cost reduction.

---

## Evaluation Framework (7 Dimensions)

Please score each dimension 0-100 and provide verdict (PASS/FAIL/CONDITIONAL).

### 1. IF.TTT Compliance (Critical - Most Important)

**Question:** Are there ANY unsourced Gedimat €amounts or operational metrics?

**What to check:**
- Search the document for patterns like:
  - "Gedimat économisera [number]€/an"
  - "réduction de [number]% des coûts"
  - "ROI [number]× sur 12 mois"
  - Any specific Gedimat numbers NOT in a formula or labeled hypothesis

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ ≥95% of claims are either:
  - Formulas with variables: `RSI = [Baseline factures 30j] / [Investissement] × [8-15%]`
  - External examples: "Leroy Merlin 55% e-commerce growth (source: ADEO Overview 2023)"
  - Labeled hypothesis: "Application hypothétique Gedimat (À VALIDER avec données réelles)"

**Critical failure:**
- ❌ ANY unsourced Gedimat €amount ("Gedimat économisera 50.000€/an" without baseline data)
- ❌ ANY operational metric without data source ("30% réduction des retards" without measurement baseline)

**Why this matters:** The PDG will be questioned by the CFO. If any number is unsourced, the entire dossier loses credibility.

**Your verdict:**
- **PASS:** Zero unsourced Gedimat claims found
- **FAIL:** Found [X] unsourced claims (list them with line/section references)
- **CONDITIONAL:** Minor issues that can be fixed quickly

---

### 2. Executive Readiness (High Priority)

**Question:** Can the PDG present Section 1 (Résumé Exécutif) to the board standalone without reading the rest?

**What to check:**
- Read ONLY Section 1, pretend you haven't read anything else
- Can you answer these questions from Section 1 alone?
  - What's the problem?
  - What's the opportunity?
  - What are we recommending? (3 axes: quick wins, medium-term, long-term)
  - What's the expected ROI? (formulas, scenarios)
  - What decision is needed?
- Is the tone humble (not arrogant)?
- Is the French professional (zero anglicisms like "Quick Win", "dashboard", "KPI")?

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ Section 1 is ≤2 pages
- ✅ Standalone (doesn't require reading annexes)
- ✅ Professional French (0 anglicisms in Section 1)
- ✅ Humble tone (admits data collection needs, doesn't over-promise)

**Bonus points:**
- ✅ Includes behavioral psychology framing (relational capitalism vs transactional optimization)

**Your verdict:**
- **PASS:** Section 1 is board-ready as-is
- **FAIL:** Major gaps or tone issues
- **CONDITIONAL:** Minor fixes needed (e.g., remove 2-3 anglicisms)

---

### 3. Actionability (Operational Feasibility)

**Question:** Can Angélique (the logistics coordinator) execute the "Quick Wins" in Week 1 with her current resources?

**What to check:**
- Section 5 (Recommandations)
- Look for Quick Wins (0-30 days actions)
- Check if they require:
  - ✅ Tools she has: Excel, email, current ERP
  - ❌ Tools she doesn't have: "Buy WMS software for 30K€", "Implement TMS platform"
- Check if data is accessible:
  - ✅ "Use factures Médiafret from last 30 days"
  - ❌ "Collect 90 days of GPS tracking data"
- Check if time is realistic:
  - ✅ "2-4 hours/week"
  - ❌ "Full-time for 6 months"

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ At least 3 of 4 Quick Wins are executable with:
  - Current tools (Excel, email, simple automation)
  - Accessible data (invoices, customer lists, existing reports)
  - Realistic time (2-10 hours total for Week 1 setup)

**Your verdict:**
- **PASS:** [X]/4 Quick Wins executable immediately
- **FAIL:** Most Quick Wins require expensive software or unavailable data
- **CONDITIONAL:** Minor tweaks needed (e.g., simplify one recommendation)

---

### 4. Behavioral Psychology Integration (Strategic Depth)

**Question:** Does the dossier leverage Rory Sutherland behavioral economics insights to add strategic depth beyond pure cost optimization?

**What to check:**
Look for these 8 specific sections (they should be explicitly labeled):

1. **Section 1 enhancement:** Relational capitalism framing?
2. **Section 3.5:** "Psychologie B2B et Fidélisation" - Problems well resolved = greater loyalty?
3. **Section 5.5:** "Le Geste Relationnel (Trust Signal)" - Small unexpected gestures?
4. **Section 6.5:** "Gouvernance Comportementale" - Zero-loser principle (SCARF model)?
5. **Section 7.5:** "Stress-Test Comportemental" - Inverted question ("Why would clients leave anyway?")?
6. **Section 8.5:** "Indicateurs de Récupération (Recovery Metrics)" - IRL-1, IRL-2, IRL-3?
7. **Section 9.5:** "Crédibilité du RSI" - "Too good to be true" credibility signal?
8. **Section 9.6:** "Arbitrages Relationnels" - Relational investments ≠ waste?

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ All 8 sections present
- ✅ Each cites Rory Sutherland (Vice Chairman Ogilvy UK) or David Rock (SCARF model)
- ✅ Each includes external B2C examples (Ritz-Carlton, Zappos, DoubleTree) and hypothetical B2B applications
- ✅ All Gedimat applications labeled "hypothétique (À VALIDER)"

**Why this matters:** This differentiates the dossier from standard logistics optimization reports. It's not just "reduce costs 12%", it's "build long-term client loyalty through predictable support during incidents."

**Your verdict:**
- **PASS:** [X]/8 sections found with proper citations
- **FAIL:** Missing most behavioral sections or no Rory Sutherland citations
- **CONDITIONAL:** Sections present but citations weak

---

### 5. French Language Quality (Professional Standard)

**Question:** Is the French professional, clear, and appropriate for C-suite executives?

**What to check:**
- Count anglicisms in Section 1 (Résumé Exécutif):
  - ❌ "Quick Win" → ✅ "Gain Rapide"
  - ❌ "dashboard" → ✅ "tableau de bord"
  - ❌ "KPI" → ✅ "Indicateurs Clés de Performance (ICP)"
  - ❌ "ROI" → ✅ "Retour sur Investissement (RSI)"
  - ❌ "benchmark" → ✅ "référence externe" or "cas externe"
- Is the tone professional business French (not academic, not marketing)?
- Are technical terms explained on first use?

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ 0 anglicisms in Section 1
- ✅ <5 anglicisms in entire document (with French equivalent given on first use)
- ✅ Professional business tone throughout

**Your verdict:**
- **PASS:** Professional French, C-suite appropriate
- **FAIL:** Multiple anglicisms or inappropriate tone
- **CONDITIONAL:** 2-3 anglicisms in Section 1 (easy fix)

---

### 6. External Benchmarks Credibility (Trust Factor)

**Question:** Can someone verify the 3 external benchmarks if the board asks?

**What to check:**
Section 4 should reference 3 external cases:

1. **Leroy Merlin / ADEO**
   - Claimed metric: 55% e-commerce growth 2021, 11-15% cost reduction
   - Source URLs provided?
   - Click the URLs: Do they work? Do they lead to legitimate sources (company reports, industry publications)?
   - Verify data: Does the source document actually contain the claimed metric?

2. **Kingfisher Group / Castorama**
   - Claimed metric: NPS tracked monthly at Group level
   - Source URLs provided?
   - Verify: Kingfisher annual reports mention NPS tracking?

3. **Saint-Gobain Transport Control Tower**
   - Claimed metric: -13% CO₂, >$10M savings over 5 years
   - Source URLs provided?
   - Verify: Logistics industry publication or Saint-Gobain report confirms this?

**Pass criteria:**
- ✅ 3/3 benchmarks have working URLs
- ✅ URLs lead to credible sources (not random blogs)
- ✅ Data matches claimed metrics (or is reasonably close)

**Critical failure:**
- ❌ ANY benchmark with fake citation (e.g., "LSA Conso Mars 2023 p.34" that doesn't exist)
- ❌ URLs that 404 or lead to unrelated content

**Your verdict:**
- **PASS:** 3/3 benchmarks verifiable
- **FAIL:** Fake citations or broken URLs
- **CONDITIONAL:** URLs work but data is approximate (acceptable if disclosed)

---

### 7. Overall Board Presentation Risk (Synthesis)

**Question:** Would YOU stake YOUR professional reputation on the PDG presenting this dossier to the board?

**Consider:**
- **Credibility risks:** Any phantom numbers that could embarrass the PDG if the CFO challenges them?
- **Completeness:** Any obvious gaps?
  - Legal compliance? (French transport regulations, GDPR, franchise contracts)
  - Risk mitigation? (What if Angélique quits? What if scoring recommends wrong depot?)
  - Pilot success metrics? (How do we know if it worked?)
- **Tone:** Professional humility or arrogant over-promises?
- **Actionability:** Concrete next steps or vague "we need more study" recommendations?

**Your verdict:**
- **YES (APPROVED):** I would stake my reputation on this. Present to board as-is.
- **MAYBE (CONDITIONAL):** Fix these P0 issues first (list them), then present.
- **NO (REJECTED):** Too risky. Major rework needed before board presentation.

## Optional: Comparison to Standard Consulting Deliverables

If you've reviewed other strategic dossiers or consulting reports, how does this compare?

- **Innovation:** Is IF.TTT methodology (zero phantom numbers) genuinely novel?
- **Depth:** Does behavioral psychology integration add real value or is it superficial?
- **Practicality:** Is this more actionable than typical "we need more study" consulting reports?
- **Cost:** At $1.50 total cost (AI-generated with human oversight), is this competitive with human-only deliverables at $5K-50K?

[Your comparative analysis here]

## Why This Review Matters

This is a **research test** of the IF.TTT methodology (Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy) in real-world consulting deliverables.

**Hypothesis:** Most strategic dossiers contain "phantom numbers" - unsourced claims that look credible until someone checks them, then the entire deliverable loses credibility.

**IF.TTT Solution:** Every claim links to:
1. Observable source (external benchmark with URL)
2. Formula with data requirements (invite client to insert THEIR numbers)
3. Explicit hypothesis label ("À VALIDER avec données réelles")

**Success criteria:** If this review finds zero unsourced Gedimat €amounts, it proves IF.TTT prevents phantom numbers at scale.

**Your role:** You are the external validator. Would you certify this dossier as ready for board presentation?

---

## Thank You

Your thorough review will help validate (or challenge) the IF.TTT methodology and improve the quality of AI-generated consulting deliverables.

Please be BRUTALLY HONEST. If you find unsourced claims, call them out with line references. The goal is to prevent PDG embarrassment, not to validate the methodology at all costs.

**Expected review time:** 30-45 minutes for thorough evaluation
