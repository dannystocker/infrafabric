## CRITICAL FINDINGS SNAPSHOT

### The Problem in One Sentence
**"The Gedimat dossier is 86/100 in methodology but 40/100 in financial credibility because all money claims (50K€, 5K€, 10×, ROI, payback) have zero sources."**

### What Will Kill You in Presentation
```
PDG: "Where did you get the 50K€ savings?"
You: "It's based on 120K€ annual affrètement... estimated"
PDG: "Estimated? Show me our invoices, not estimates. Show me the 120K€."
You: [No invoices provided]
PDG: "This whole ROI is made up. Next slide?"
```

### The 8 Credibility Bombs
1. **50K€ gains** - No source
2. **5K€ investment** - No source
3. **10× ROI** - Derived from unsourced numbers
4. **3.3M€ CA** - Assumed, never verified
5. **30K€/quarter** - Baseline invented
6. **120K€/year** - Annual budget phantom
7. **30% reduction** - No justification shown
8. **88% service** - Inferred from complaints, not measured

## ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Fast Track (Parallel Approach - RECOMMENDED)
**Timeline:** 14 days to 95/100 dossier

```
WEEK 1 (16-23 Nov):
  - Approve Enhancement execution (add sources) → 90/100
  - Send GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM to Angélique
  - Target: Gedimat responds by 23 Nov with 2024 data

WEEK 2 (24-30 Nov):
  - Receive Gedimat data & analyze
  - Merge Enhancement results + validated data
  - Produce final 95/100 dossier ready for Board
```

Cost: ~12$ USD (Enhancement) + internal time
Risk: Medium (depends on Gedimat response speed)
Result: Complete, defensible, sourced dossier

---

### Option B: Conservative Track (Data First)
**Timeline:** 15 days to 95/100 dossier

```
WEEK 1 (16-23 Nov):
  - Send GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM immediately
  - Wait for responses (target 23 Nov)

WEEK 2 (24-30 Nov):
  - Analyze Gedimat data
  - Recalculate all financial claims
  - Produce 95/100 dossier with verified numbers

OPTIONAL (27 Nov onwards):
  - Run Enhancement in parallel for academic/legal sources
```

Cost: 0$ initially (internal only) + ~8$ if Enhancement approved later
Risk: Low (data-driven from start)
Result: Defensible, internally verified dossier

---

### Option C: Operational Now (Honest Approach)
**Timeline:** Immediate deployment, upgrade later

```
TODAY (16 Nov):
  - Use 86/100 dossier for operational tools only
  - Angélique gets scoring spreadsheet, NPS template, scripts
  - Acknowledge financial claims need data validation

PARALLEL (Background):
  - Send GEDIMAT_DATA_VALIDATION_FORM for data collection
  - Run Enhancement when resources available

UPGRADE (January 2025):
  - Merged 95/100 version ready for Board review
```

Cost: 0$ now, 8-12$ later
Risk: Zero (honest about current state)
Result: Immediately useful tools + future credible analysis

## CREDIBILITY RECOVERY PATH

### Current State (16 Nov)
```
Methodology: 86/100 (excellent structure, 8 passes, 26 voices, IF.TTT framework)
Financial credibility: 40/100 (50K€, 5K€, 10×, all unsourced)
```

### After Enhancement Only (23 Nov)
```
Methodology: 96/100 (add legal/academic sources)
Financial credibility: 45/100 (same unsourced Gedimat numbers)
= Still not ready for Board unless "estimates clearly marked"
```

### After Data Collection Only (25 Nov)
```
Methodology: 85/100 (no enhancement yet)
Financial credibility: 95/100 (verified Gedimat data)
= Ready for Board if sources correct
```

### After Both Combined (30 Nov)
```
Methodology: 97/100 (legal + academic sources added)
Financial credibility: 95/100 (verified Gedimat data)
= FULLY DEFENSIBLE, Board-ready, can present without hesitation
```

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### If You Present Current Dossier (86/100) to Board
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL FAILURE
- PDG will ask about 50K€ savings
- No source = credibility destroyed
- Board loses confidence in entire analysis
- Investment decision blocked

### If You Present After Enhancement Only (90/100)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
- Academic/legal sources impress
- But Gedimat financial claims still "estimé"
- PDG asks "Is this your data or industry estimates?"
- Decision delayed pending data verification

### If You Present After Data Collection (95/100)
**Risk Level:** LOW
- All financial claims tied to 2024 invoices
- Service audit shows actual baseline
- NPS survey validates customer sentiment
- PDG confident in numbers = approval likely

## COST ANALYSIS

| Approach | Enhancement Cost | Time Cost | Total Cost | Credibility |
|----------|------------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| A (Parallel) | 12$ | 1 day | 12$ | 95/100 |
| B (Data-First) | 8$ | 2 days | 20$ | 95/100 |
| C (Operational) | 0$ | 2 days | 20$ | 86/100 now, 95/100 later |

**Note:** "Time cost" = internal labor equivalent. All achievable within existing budgets.
