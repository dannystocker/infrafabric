**Timeline:** Responses needed by 23 November 2025 for final dossier validation

## SECTION 1: FINANCIAL BASELINE

### 1.1 Annual Revenue (CA) - 2024 YTD
**Question:** What is Gedimat's total revenue (chiffre d'affaires) for 2024?

**Why we need this:** Our savings calculation assumes 3.3M€ - if different, all ROI projections must be recalculated.

**Data requested:**
```
[ ] 2024 revenue to date: __________ €
    (If unclear, provide: Jan-Oct total or 9-month budget)
[ ] Estimated full-year 2024: __________ €
[ ] Last 2 years for trend: 2023: __________ €  |  2022: __________ €
```

**If 2024 revenue ≠ 3.3M€:**
- We will recalculate savings: 3.3M€ × 1.5% reduction = 49.5K€ becomes: **[Your CA] × 1.5% = __________ €**

---

### 1.2 Médiafret Annual Transport Costs
**Question:** What does Gedimat spend annually on affrètement externe (Médiafret)?

**Why we need this:** The 50K€ savings claim depends entirely on knowing current spend and achievable reduction.

**Data requested:**
```
[ ] Invoice summary Médiafret:
    - 2024 Jan: _______ €
    - 2024 Feb: _______ €
    - 2024 Mar: _______ €
    - 2024 Apr: _______ €
    - 2024 May: _______ €
    - 2024 Jun: _______ €
    - 2024 Jul: _______ €
    - 2024 Aug: _______ €
    - 2024 Sep: _______ €
    - 2024 Oct: _______ €

    TOTAL (10 months): __________ €
    Estimated Full Year 2024: __________ €

    OR simply: Average monthly Médiafret cost = __________ €/month

[ ] Quarterly breakdown (if monthly not available):

    - Q2 2024 (Apr-Jun): __________ €
    - Q3 2024 (Jul-Sep): __________ €
    (Q4 estimate or partial): __________ €
```

**Current Dossier Assumptions (to verify):**
- We assumed: 120K€/year OR 30K€/quarter
- Please confirm if this matches reality: YES / NO / CLOSE (±10%)

**Achievable Reduction Target:**
```
Once we know actual spend, we estimate:
25% reduction (conservative) = __________ € savings/year
30% reduction (moderate) = __________ € savings/year
35% reduction (ambitious) = __________ € savings/year

Which target seems realistic to you? __________ %
```

## SECTION 2: OPERATIONAL BASELINE

### 2.1 Current Service Level (On-Time Delivery Rate)
**Question:** What percentage of orders are delivered on the promised date?

**Why we need this:** Dossier claims Gedimat current = ~88%. We need actual audit to validate, as this determines improvement potential.

**Data requested - Option A (Ideal):**
Provide 50 recent customer deliveries with:

```
Order Date | Customer | Promised Date | Actual Date | Status | Days Late/Early
---------|----------|---------------|-------------|--------|----------------
2024-11-01 | Client A | 2024-11-05    | 2024-11-05  | ON TIME | 0
2024-11-02 | Client B | 2024-11-07    | 2024-11-09  | LATE    | +2
... (50 orders)
```

**Calculation:** (# On-time orders ÷ Total orders) × 100% = __________ %

**Data requested - Option B (If detailed export not available):**
```
[ ] Last 3 months (Aug-Oct 2024):
    - Total deliveries: __________
    - Delivered on-time (±24h of promise): __________
    - Current on-time rate: __________ %

[ ] How do you currently track on-time delivery?
    [ ] ERP system (can export report)
    [ ] Angélique's manual tracking
    [ ] Customer complaints (only count of late)
    [ ] Not formally tracked
```

**Validate Dossier Assumption:**
- We assumed 88% current on-time rate
- Does this match your experience? YES / NO / HIGHER / LOWER

---

### 2.2 Delivery Delay Causes
**Question:** When a delivery is late, what's the typical reason?

**Why we need this:** Knowing if delays are fournisseur vs. transport vs. coordination helps prioritize scoring improvements.

**Data requested:**
```
Of the orders that were LATE in last 3 months (Aug-Oct 2024):

[ ] Reason breakdown (estimate %):
    - Fournisseur delay (supplier didn't deliver to Gedimat on time): __________ %
    - Transport delay (Médiafret or internal driver delay): __________ %
    - Coordination issue (order misplaced, dépôt selection problem): __________ %
    - Stock issue (ordered but item unavailable at dépôt): __________ %
    - Other: __________ %
    TOTAL = 100%

[ ] Example recent delay:
    Fournisseur: ____________________
    Date promised to customer: __________
    Date Gedimat received from fournisseur: __________
    Date delivered to customer: __________
    Root cause: _______________________________
```

## SECTION 3: CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BASELINE

### 3.1 NPS - Net Promoter Score (B2B Customers)
**Question:** How satisfied are your B2B customers (artisans, petites entreprises)?

**Why we need this:** Dossier assumes NPS ~35. We recommend measuring actual NPS to ground improvement targets.

**Data requested - Option A (Formal Survey):**

Please conduct brief survey of 20-30 of your B2B customers (artisans BTP):

```
Short survey message (SMS or email):

"Gedimat vous demande votre avis rapidement.
Recommanderiez-vous nos services à un collègue?
Tapez 0-10: (0=pas du tout, 10=tout à fait)

Réponse: _____

Un problème à évoquer? (optionnel):
_________________________________"

Results:
- Count of 9-10 responses: __________ = Promoters
- Count of 7-8 responses: __________ = Passives
- Count of 0-6 responses: __________ = Detractors

NPS Calculation: (Promoters% - Detractors%) = __________ %

Is this better/worse than competitors (est. 45-52)?
__________ BETTER / WORSE / SIMILAR
```

**Data requested - Option B (Informal Feedback):**
If formal survey not possible, quantify:
```
[ ] Main customer complaints (last 6 months):
    - Delivery delays: __________ # complaints
    - Stock-outs (item unavailable): __________ # complaints
    - Communication issues: __________ # complaints
    - Price: __________ # complaints
    - Quality: __________ # complaints
    TOTAL complaints: __________ /month average

[ ] Positive feedback (when received):
    - "Fast delivery": __________ # times
    - "Good service": __________ # times
    - "Reliable": __________ # times
    TOTAL positive: __________ /month average

Implied ratio: (Negative: Positive) = __________ : __________
Current informal NPS estimate: __________ (your gut feeling 0-50)?
```

## SECTION 4: SCORING MODEL CALIBRATION

### 4.1 Weight Validation
**Question:** Does the scoring model's weight split make sense for your operations?

**Dossier proposes:**
```
Score = 40% Urgence + 30% Coût + 20% Volume + 10% Distance
```

**Validation:**
```
For your dépôts, which matters MORE for choosing optimal delivery site?

Rank from 1 (most important) to 4 (least important):

___ Urgence client (chantier date fixe vs flexible)
___ Coût transport (moins cher = priorité)
___ Volume commande (livrer grosse commande ensemble vs faire plusieurs trajets)
___ Distance fournisseur → dépôt (proximité vs détour)

Alternative calibration if different priorities:
___ % Urgence    +  ___ % Coût  +  ___ % Volume  +  ___ % Distance = 100%
```

---

### 4.2 Reduction Target Validation
**Question:** Is 25-30% cost reduction realistic?

**Why we ask:** If you say "impossible," the whole ROI model fails. If you say "easily 40%," we're being conservative.

**Data requested:**
```
[ ] Looking at recent affrètements:

    Q: What % of your Médiafret shipments would you consider
       "could have been consolidated or routed better"?

    Estimate: __________ % (0-50%)

    Example: "We ship 15 tonnes in 3 separate trucks when 1 truck
    could have done it (25t capacity)" = 2/3 wasted routes = ~67% waste

[ ] If we implemented scoring + consolidated better, what's realistic?
    [ ] 10-15% reduction (low confidence)
    [ ] 20-25% reduction (medium confidence)
    [ ] 30-35% reduction (high confidence)
    [ ] 40%+ reduction (very high confidence)

    Your opinion: __________ %
    Confidence: LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
```

## SECTION 5: IMPLEMENTATION FEASIBILITY

### 5.1 Tool Development
**Question:** Can Gedimat deploy Excel scoring tool internally?

```

## PREVIEW: What Changes in Final Dossier

**Current (86/100):**
> "Gedimat affrètement costs ~120K€/an, baseline service 88%, NPS ~35,
> estimated savings 50K€/year with 40/30/20/10 scoring model. ROI 10×"

**After YOUR data (95/100):**
> "Gedimat 2024 affrètement actual: 127K€/9 months = 170K€ annualized.
> Audit shows 86% on-time delivery (52 orders Sep-Oct).
> NPS survey (25 clients): 38 actual score.
> Realistic reduction target: 28% = 47.6K€/year.
> Development cost: 4.2K€.
> **Verified ROI: 11.3× | Payback: 5.2 weeks**"

The difference: **One is estimate, one is defensible fact.**
