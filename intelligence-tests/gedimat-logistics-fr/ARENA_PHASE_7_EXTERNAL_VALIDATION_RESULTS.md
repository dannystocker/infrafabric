### 2. French Language Quality (98.3/100 average)

**P0 Fix Success:**
- All 6 evaluators confirmed **zero anglicisms in body text**
- 38 replacements verified complete
- Only acceptable exceptions in code blocks/templates

**Specific Validation:**
- ✅ "Quick Win" → "Gain Rapide" (all instances)
- ✅ "dashboard" → "tableau de bord" (all instances)
- ✅ "KPI" → "ICP" (all instances)
- ✅ "ROI" → "RSI" (all formulas)
