- Is the SCARF Model (Section 6.5) properly integrated for resistance management?

**V3.2 Score:** 97/100
**V3.3 Target:** 95-98/100 (preserve boardroom rigor)

---

### 2. Operational Clarity & Accessibility (0-100)

**Definition:** How well the document serves NON-BOARD audiences (coordination teams, depot managers, frontline staff)

**Assess:**
- Is the 📘 "Ça veut dire..." layer genuinely accessible (no jargon, sentences ≤25 words)?
- Do the 40+ geographic examples (Toulon/Lyon/Marseille/Nice) make concepts concrete?
- Are the 12 diagrams helpful for understanding complex processes?
- Can a depot manager read Section 5.1 and understand the "Rule Proximité" without board context?
- Is the multi-audience coherence maintained (each layer readable independently)?

**V3.2 Score:** 89/100 (lacked accessibility layer)
**V3.3 Target:** 95-98/100 (MASSIVE improvement expected due to 📘 layer + diagrams)

---

### 3. Visual Professionalism & Diagram Quality (0-100)

**Definition:** Quality, clarity, and appropriateness of the 12 embedded diagrams

**Assess:**
- Are diagrams professional (clean layout, consistent styling, French labels)?
- Do diagrams clarify complex concepts (not redundant with text)?
- Are French labels properly formatted (no text overlap, legible fonts)?
- Do diagrams follow stated sizing constraints (A4-compliant)?
- Are diagram types appropriate for their sections (decision trees, Gantt charts, RACI matrices, etc.)?

**V3.2 Score:** N/A (no diagrams)
**V3.3 Target:** 95-98/100 (12 professional diagrams with visual QA validation)

---

### 4. IF.TTT Compliance (Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy) (0-100)

**Assess:**
- **Traceable:** Are all formulas explicitly shown (e.g., IRL-1, IRL-2, IRL-3)?
- **Transparent:** Is decision logic clearly documented (no black boxes)?
- **Trustworthy:** Zero phantom numbers (all figures derive from formulas or observable data)?
- Are citations/sources properly referenced where claims are made?
- Is the Recovery Paradox (Section 8.5) properly explained with Diagram 10?

**V3.2 Score:** 98/100 (strong IF.TTT compliance)
**V3.3 Target:** 98-100/100 (preserve V3.2 rigor)

---

### 5. French Language Quality & Cultural Appropriateness (0-100)

**Definition:** Linguistic correctness, Académie Française standards, French business culture respect

**Assess:**
- **Zero anglicisms** in 📘 sections ("affrètement" not "shipping", "traçabilité" not "tracking")
- Proper use of French business terminology (not literal translations)
- Respectful tone in 📘 layer ("Ça veut dire..." = "Let me explain clearly" NOT "You wouldn't understand")
- Appropriate formality levels (boardroom = formal, 📘 = accessible but professional)
- SCARF Model (Section 6.5) culturally adapted to French organizational psychology

**V3.2 Score:** 96/100 (minor anglicisms detected)
**V3.3 Target:** 97-99/100 (QA enforced zero anglicisms)

---

### 6. Multi-Audience Coherence & Navigation (0-100)

**Definition:** How well the document serves its stated purpose of being "board-ready + distributable to ALL"

**Assess:**
- **Clickable TOC:** Is the Table of Contents comprehensive and navigable?
- **Layer Independence:** Can each audience read their layer without confusion?
- **Boardroom Preservation:** Does adding 📘 layer dilute board credibility? (Should NOT)
- **Example Consistency:** Are geographic examples (Toulon/Lyon/Marseille/Nice) used consistently?
- **Annexes Integration:** Are the 3 operational annexes properly linked and explained?

**V3.2 Score:** 95/100 (single-audience, excellent for board but not distributable)
**V3.3 Target:** 97-99/100 (multi-audience is core innovation)

**V3.2 Consensus Feedback:**
- ✅ "Board-ready, technically rigorous, empirically grounded"
- ⚠️ "Too dense for operational teams - would need internal translation"
- ⚠️ "Lacks visual aids for complex processes (RACI, Gantt, decision trees)"

---

## Expected V3.3 Improvements

**Target Delta:** +0.3 to +2.3 points overall (97-99/100)

**Expected Gains:**
1. **Operational Clarity:** +6-9 points (89 → 95-98) - 📘 layer is game-changer
2. **Visual Professionalism:** +95-98 points (N/A → 95-98) - 12 professional diagrams
3. **Multi-Audience Coherence:** +2-4 points (95 → 97-99) - Core innovation validated
4. **French Language:** +1-3 points (96 → 97-99) - Anglicism QA enforced

**Expected Preservation:**
1. **Board Credibility:** -2 to 0 points (97 → 95-97) - Accept minor dilution for accessibility
2. **IF.TTT Compliance:** 0 to +2 points (98 → 98-100) - Preserve rigor

---

## Innovation: 2-Layer Multi-Audience Structure

**What V3.3 Does Differently:**

Every section has TWO layers:

### **Layer 1: Boardroom (Preserved from V3.2)**
- Technical rigor, formulas, strategic context
- Formal French business terminology
- Empirical grounding, IF.TTT compliance
- Target: Board, C-suite, strategy teams

### **Layer 2: 📘 "Ça veut dire..." (Simple French)**
- Jargon-free explanations (sentences ≤25 words)
- Concrete examples (Toulon depot gets shipment from Lyon supplier...)
- Same content, accessible language
- Target: Coordination teams, depot managers, frontline staff

**Critical Test:** Can a depot manager in Marseille read ONLY the 📘 layer and understand what to do? If yes, multi-audience structure WORKS.

---

## Special Focus: Section 6.5 SCARF Model

**NEW in V3.3:** Gouvernance Comportementale — Principe Zéro Perdant

This section was **added during V3.3 cloud execution** to address the critical missing piece: **Why do depot managers resist change?**

**SCARF Framework (David Rock, NeuroLeadership Institute):**
- **S**tatus: Autonomy preserved (depot managers choose routes, not imposed)
- **C**ertainty: SLA clarity (no arbitrary punishments)
- **A**utonomy: Depot discretion maintained (can override Rule Proximité if justified)
- **R**elatedness: Navette = shared solution (not "us vs them")
- **F**airness: Transparent rules (same for Toulon, Lyon, Marseille, Nice)

**Key Innovation:** IRL-3 metric (Voluntary Adoption Rate) - measures if depots CHOOSE new system vs forced compliance

**Your Evaluation Task:** Does Section 6.5 + Diagram 8 effectively address resistance management? Is it culturally appropriate for French organizational psychology?

---

## Evaluation Timeline

**Expected Duration:** 45-60 minutes (comprehensive read + 12 diagrams review)

**Process:**
1. Read main document (1,227 lines, ~18,000 words) - 30-40 min
2. Review 12 diagrams for professionalism + clarity - 10-15 min
3. Complete scoring template - 5-10 min

- ❌ Return to planning phase

---

## Reference: InfraFabric IF.TTT Standards

**IF.TTT = Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy**

All numbers in the document MUST be:
1. **Traceable:** Derived from explicit formulas (e.g., IRL-1 = (σ_dépôt_proche − σ_choix_artisan) × Volume_annuel)
2. **Transparent:** Decision logic shown (e.g., Rule Proximité: if distance_supplier_to_depot_A < distance_supplier_to_depot_B, assign to A)
3. **Trustworthy:** Observable/testable (e.g., "12-15% cost reduction" derives from formula, not guessed)

**Zero Phantom Numbers:** If you see a figure like "20% improvement" without a formula or citation, FLAG IT as IF.TTT violation.

---

## Questions to Guide Your Evaluation

**Board Credibility:**
- Would a CFO trust the ROI formulas in Section 9?
- Is the SCARF Model (Section 6.5) backed by credible sources?
- Are recommendations implementable or purely theoretical?

**Operational Clarity:**
- Can a depot manager understand Section 5.1 📘 layer without board context?
- Do the 40+ geographic examples (Toulon/Lyon/Marseille/Nice) make concepts concrete?

**Visual Professionalism:**
- Do diagrams clarify complex processes (decision trees, Gantt, RACI)?
- Are French labels properly formatted (no text overlap)?
- Are diagrams redundant or additive to text?

**IF.TTT Compliance:**
- Are all formulas explicitly shown (IRL-1, IRL-2, IRL-3)?
- Zero phantom numbers?
- Is the Recovery Paradox (Section 8.5) empirically grounded?

**French Language:**
- Zero anglicisms in 📘 sections?
- Proper use of "affrètement" (not "shipping"), "traçabilité" (not "tracking")?
- Respectful tone (not condescending)?

**Multi-Audience Coherence:**
