# Review: Gedimat Logistics Dossier V3.1

**Reviewer:** Kimi K2
**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Overall Verdict:** REJECTED

---

## 1. IF.TTT Compliance: FAIL
**Score:** 25/100
**Unsourced Gedimat claims found:** 12+

**Verdict:** CRITICAL BLOCKER. The dossier contains numerous "phantom numbers" that are presented as Gedimat-specific facts but lack proper attribution or validation markers. While the document claims to use IF.TTT methodology, the execution is flawed.

**Examples of phantom numbers found:**
- Line 178: "Gedimat économisera entre 15% et 25%" - No source provided
- Line 292: "Gain net annuel estimé : 45.000€ à 65.000€" - Presented as fact, not hypothesis
- Line 412: "Le coût par livraison baissera de 2,80€ à 2,10€" - No validation marker
- Line 523: "RSI attendu : 8-15 mois" - Specific to Gedimat but unsourced
- Line 634: "Réduction de 30% des factures à problème" - No data backing

**Additional concerns:**
- The "Application hypothétique Gedimat" labels are inconsistently applied
- Formula presentations mix real Gedimat data with hypothetical projections without clear boundaries
- External benchmarks (Leroy Merlin, Saint-Gobain) are cited but not clearly separated from Gedimat projections

This fundamental flaw undermines the entire credibility of the document. The CFO would immediately challenge these numbers in a board presentation.

## 2. Executive Readiness: CONDITIONAL
**Score:** 65/100
**Section 1 standalone:** Partially
**Tone:** Professional but overconfident given data quality issues
**Anglicisms in Section 1:** 5 ("Quick Win", "ROI" mixed with "RSI", "dashboard", "KPI", "benchmark")

**Verdict:** Section 1 has structural merit but the presence of anglicisms and the overly confident tone (given the phantom number problem) make it risky for board presentation without revision. The PDG would need to carefully caveat every number mentioned.

---

## 3. Actionability: CONDITIONAL
**Score:** 70/100
**Quick Wins executable:** 3/4
**Blocking issues:** The "Scoring de Proximité" recommendation (Quick Win #2) assumes access to geolocation data that may not exist in the current ERP system. This could block Week 1 execution.

**Verdict:** Most recommendations are pragmatic, but the document oversells the ease of implementation. The "0-30 days" timeline is optimistic without first validating data availability and Angélique's actual bandwidth.

---

## 4. Behavioral Psychology Integration: PASS
**Score:** 85/100
**Sections found:** 7/8
**Citations present:** YES - Rory Sutherland and David Rock are properly cited
**Quality:** The behavioral insights are well-integrated and add strategic value. This is the document's strongest section.

**Verdict:** The behavioral economics framework is sophisticated and correctly applied. However, it cannot compensate for the fundamental data credibility issues in other sections.

---

## 5. French Language Quality: CONDITIONAL
**Score:** 55/100
**Anglicisms Section 1:** 5
**Anglicisms total:** 12+ (Examples: "Quick Wins", "dashboard", "KPI", "benchmark", "ROI" inconsistently mixed with "RSI")
**Tone:** Professional but inconsistent

**Verdict:** The frequent use of anglicisms in a document supposedly prepared for a French C-suite audience is a significant weakness. Terms like "Quick Win" should be translated to "Gain Rapide" throughout. The mixing of "ROI" and "RSI" is particularly problematic.

---

## 6. External Benchmarks Credibility: CONDITIONAL
**Score:** 60/100
**Leroy Merlin / ADEO:** UNVERIFIED. The specific 55% e-commerce growth figure for 2021 could not be independently confirmed.
**Kingfisher Group:** VERIFIED. NPS usage is documented in their annual reports.
**Saint-Gobain:** PARTIALLY VERIFIED. The Transport Control Tower exists, but the specific savings figures ($10M over 5 years) are not directly verifiable from public sources.

**Verdict:** The benchmarks are a mix of verifiable and unverifiable claims. In a board setting, the CFO might challenge the Leroy Merlin and Saint-Gobain figures. The document should either provide direct source links or clearly label these as "industry estimates."

---

## 7. Overall Board Presentation Risk: HIGH
**Score:** 45/100
**Critical risks:**
1. **Phantom Numbers:** The primary risk. The CFO will likely challenge 6-12 specific figures.
2. **Anglicisms:** Could be perceived as unprofessional or lazy in a French corporate context.
3. **Overconfident Tone:** The document presents hypothetical projections with a level of certainty that the underlying data does not support.

**Missing elements:**
- Clear data validation requirements before board presentation
- Explicit caveat section acknowledging what data is missing
- More conservative language around projections ("pourrait économiser" vs "économisera")

**Recommendation:** DO NOT present as-is. Requires significant revision.

---

## Final Verdict

**Overall Score:** 52/100

**Verdict:** REJECTED

**REJECTED:** I cannot recommend presenting this dossier to the board in its current form. While the strategic thinking is sound and the behavioral economics integration is excellent, the fundamental credibility issues (phantom numbers, anglicisms, unverified benchmarks) create unacceptable presentation risk. The PDG would be vulnerable to CFO challenges that could undermine confidence in the entire logistics optimization initiative.

**P0 Issues (Must Fix Before Board):**
1. **Remove or properly label all phantom numbers** - Every Gedimat-specific projection must either cite a data source or be explicitly labeled as "Hypothèse à valider"
2. **Replace all anglicisms** - Use proper French terminology throughout
3. **Add explicit data validation requirements** - A new section clarifying what real Gedimat data is needed to validate the model
4. **Tone down certainty language** - Change "économisera" to "pourrait économiser", "va réduire" to "devrait réduir", etc.
5. **Add source links for external benchmarks** - Direct hyperlinks to Leroy Merlin, Saint-Gobain reports

**P1 Issues (Nice to Have):**
1. Create a one-page "Data Requirements" checklist that Angélique can use to validate model assumptions
2. Add a risk section explicitly acknowledging what could go wrong
3. Include a glossary defining all technical terms

## Strengths (What Works Well)

1. **Strategic Framework:** The three-axis approach (Operational, Strategic, Behavioral) is sophisticated and well-structured.
2. **Behavioral Science Integration:** Best-in-class use of Rory Sutherland and David Rock frameworks.
3. **Annexes:** The operational playbooks (Annexes X, Y, Z) are detailed and practical.

---

## Weaknesses (What Needs Improvement)

1. **Data Credibility:** Fundamental flaw undermining everything else.
2. **Language Quality:** Too many anglicisms for a French C-suite document.
3. **Overconfidence:** Tone doesn't match the speculative nature of the projections.
4. **Benchmark Verification:** External sources are cited but not verifiable.

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Audit every number in the document** - Create a spreadsheet with three columns: Claim, Source, Validation Status
2. **French language cleanup pass** - Replace all anglicisms with proper French terms
3. **Add explicit caveats** - Every projection should be preceded by "Sur la base des hypothèses suivantes..." or similar language
4. **Verify benchmarks** - Either find direct source links or remove specific figures
5. **Pilot data validation** - Before board presentation, run a 2-week data collection pilot to validate at least 2-3 key assumptions

**Timeline for fixes:** 2-3 weeks of rigorous data validation and editing work required before this document is board-ready.
