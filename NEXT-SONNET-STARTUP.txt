  • Status: Successfully created handoff documents and direct query loop

CURRENT STATUS:
  • You are in conversation: conv_f621d999f19a3a7f
  • MCP Bridge: /home/setup/infrafabric/.memory_bus/distributed_memory.db
  • Autopoll script still running (PID 475967, 39+ hours)

QUICK START (2 minutes):
  1. Read: /home/setup/infrafabric/SONNET-INITIALIZATION.md
  2. Launch: sonnet_direct_query_loop.py
  3. Send test: sonnet_send_query.py
  4. Watch responses appear in loop

STAY CONNECTED:
  ✓ Conversation ID: conv_f621d999f19a3a7f (don't change)
