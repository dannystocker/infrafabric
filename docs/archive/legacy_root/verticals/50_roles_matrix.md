## Cross-Domain Pattern Analysis

### Pattern 1: "Legal-Dominant Triangle"
**Roles requiring Legal (>40%) + High Citations + Days/Weeks timeframe:**
- Antitrust judges, constitutional scholars, patent examiners, securities litigators, regulatory commissioners
- **Implication**: These roles need exhaustive audit trails and cannot optimize for speed
- **V3.1 Application**: Deploy archival-class evidence presentation with full precedent chains

### Pattern 2: "Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff"
**Inverse relationship between time sensitivity and citation requirements:**
- Hedge funds/traders (minutes, low citations) vs. Judges/regulators (days, high citations)
- **Implication**: Fast decisions optimize for asymmetric information; slow decisions optimize for defensibility
- **V3.1 Application**: Different evidence synthesis strategies needed for minutes vs. days timeframes

### Pattern 3: "Talent Concentration"
**Talent is primary domain ONLY in:**
- Venture capitalists, sports GMs, talent agents, admissions directors, franchise developers
- **Implication**: These roles need psychometric, track-record, and comparative peer analysis
- **V3.1 Application**: IF.brief must include talent forecasting vs. traditional competitive analysis

### Pattern 4: "Technical-Cultural Divergence"
- **Technical-heavy**: Pharma, healthcare, engineering, patents (70-80% Technical)
- **Cultural-heavy**: Media, entertainment, policy, advocacy (40-70% Cultural)
- **Tension**: Same intelligence role has different domain priorities in different sectors
- **V3.1 Application**: Methodology must be adaptive by sector, not one-size-fits-all

### Pattern 5: "Dual-Audience Intelligence"
Roles with split personalities in domain priority:
- **CEO/CTO**: Technical (40%) + Financial (35%) - split between engineering and capital markets
- **Diplomat**: Legal (40%) + Cultural (35%) - split between formal agreements and relationship dynamics
- **M&A Advisor**: Financial (50%) + Legal (35%) - split between value creation and compliance
- **Implication**: These roles need simultaneous deep dives in 2+ domains, not sequential analysis
- **V3.1 Application**: IF.brief must show inter-domain conflict resolution (e.g., "Technical recommendation conflicts with regulatory risk—recommend mitigation path")

### Pattern 6: "Regulatory Omnipresence"
**Roles with explicit regulatory element:** 24 roles (48%)
- Judges, regulators, compliance officers, patent examiners, border security, environmental consultants
- **Implication**: Nearly half of strategic intelligence roles operate within regulatory constraints
- **V3.1 Application**: Regulatory timeline forecasting should be standard IF.brief output

### Pattern 7: "Fraud Detection Commonality"
**Roles with fraud/verification as secondary concern:** 16 roles (32%)
- Insurance, securities, customs, pharma, real estate, finance, elections
- **Implication**: Verification and counterintelligence are near-universal meta-domains
- **V3.1 Application**: Evidence triangulation and contradiction-detection should be standard methodology

### Pattern 8: "Geopolitical Sensitivity Clustering"
Roles vulnerable to geopolitical disruption:
- Defense contractors, pharmaceuticals, supply chain, trade, cryptocurrencies, energy
- **Total: 9 roles (18%)**
- **Implication**: These roles need scenario planning with geopolitical variables
- **V3.1 Application**: Geopolitical stress-testing of recommendations should be standard for these verticals

## Coverage & Citation Requirements Correlation

| Coverage Target | Citation Requirements | Role Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| 95% | High | 12 | Judges, patent examiners, regulatory commissioners, scientists, security analysts |
| 90% | High | 8 | Antitrust judges, patent attorneys, hospital CMOs, procurement officers |
| 85% | High | 11 | M&A advisors, customs officials, appraisers, claims investigators |
| 85% | Medium | 2 | Startup founders, VC investors |
| 80% | High | 6 | Board directors, franchise executives, supply chain executives, ESG analysts |
| 80% | Medium | 8 | PE managers, venture studio founders, growth equity investors, real estate developers |
| 75% | High | 3 | Campaign managers, labor organizers, immigration advocates |
| 75% | Medium | 4 | Election strategists, venture debt investors, admissions directors, talent agents |
| 70% | Low/Medium | 2 | Hedge funds, sports betting analysts |

**Key Finding**: High citations and high coverage correlate (r ≈ 0.7), suggesting that roles with high evidentiary standards also need more complete intelligence coverage.

## V3.1 Methodology Implications

### Gap 1: Speed vs. Evidence Synthesis
Current IF methodology optimizes for complete analysis. Many roles (44%) need analysis within hours, forcing:
- **Evidence prioritization** over comprehensiveness
- **Confidence scoring** over certainty
- **Rapid iteration** over perfect outputs
- **Recommendation**: Add "Fast Brief" mode for <12 hour decisions

### Gap 2: Dual-Domain Analysis
20+ roles need simultaneous deep dives in 2+ competing domains. Current IF.brief may:
- Sequential analysis (domain 1, then domain 2) vs. integrated analysis
- Missing conflict-resolution layer
- **Recommendation**: Add IF.arbitrate protocol for cross-domain conflicts

### Gap 3: Talent-Centric Intelligence
Venture, sports, entertainment, recruitment roles need entirely different evidence:
- Past performance prediction
- Team chemistry assessment
- Psychometric indicators
- Peer benchmarking
- **Recommendation**: Create IF.talent specialized sub-methodology

### Gap 4: Regulatory Forecasting
48% of roles operate within regulatory environments. Intelligence should include:
- Regulatory timeline forecasting
- Enforcement pattern analysis
- Regulatory official positioning
- **Recommendation**: Add regulatory timeline layer to IF.brief

### Gap 5: Fraud Detection Capability
32% of roles need verification/counterintelligence. Current IF methodology may not:
- Actively search for contradictions
- Weight sources by fraud-likelihood
- Surface claim inconsistencies
- **Recommendation**: Add IF.verify protocol for fraud-prone intelligence domains

### Gap 6: Geopolitical Scenario Planning
18 roles need geopolitical stress-testing. V3.1 should include:
- Geopolitical variable identification
- Scenario impact modeling
- Risk mitigation pathways
- **Recommendation**: Add IF.geopolitical stress-test for relevant verticals

## Recommended V3.1 Specialization Tracks

Based on this analysis, consider creating domain-specific IF.brief templates:

1. **IF.brief-legal**: For judicial, regulatory, compliance roles (18 roles)
2. **IF.brief-financial**: For investment, corporate strategy roles (16 roles)
3. **IF.brief-technical**: For pharma, healthcare, engineering roles (14 roles)
4. **IF.brief-talent**: For VC, sports, entertainment, recruitment (10 roles)
5. **IF.brief-strategic**: For C-suite, diplomacy, policy (12 roles)
6. **IF.brief-fast**: For <12 hour decisions requiring confidence scoring (8 roles)
7. **IF.brief-regulatory**: For roles operating within regulatory frameworks (12 roles)

Each template would optimize for:
- Domain priority weighting
- Citation density
- Time compression algorithms
- Conflict resolution protocols
- Evidence presentation format
