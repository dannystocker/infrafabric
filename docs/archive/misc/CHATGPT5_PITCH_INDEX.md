## The Elevator Pitch (Copy-Paste Ready)

"InfraFabric is a universal API integration platform bundling three separate products:

1. **API Integration** (like Zapier)
2. **Secret Detection** (125× better than Trufflehog)
3. **Multi-LLM Orchestration** (proven with GPT-5)

We have 6+ months of production code, real metrics (95% hallucination reduction, 125× FP improvement), and an open-source foundation. We're not ideas guys—we shipped it.

The market: $56K-$135K per customer today. Our solution: $2,400/year bundled.

What we want: Series A funding + API partnership with OpenAI."

## Red Flags Addressed

### "This is Still Vaporware"
**Response:** 6+ months production, zero crashes, 125× metric improvement
- Proof: icantwait.ca live deployment logs, yologuard in use, GPT-5 testing results

### "We've Never Heard of You"
**Response:** We were terrible at marketing. The code was always there.
- Now packaged correctly for investors + OpenAI partnership pitch

### "Why Should OpenAI Partner?"
**Response:** Strategic alignment
- We use OpenAI APIs (Whisper, GPT-4, GPT-5)
- We promote OpenAI in multi-model swarms alongside competitors
- Philosophy-grounded = better alignment than other platforms

### "What's the Defensibility?"
**Response:** 20-module ecosystem + philosophy-grounded design
- Not just integration (anyone can do that)
- We solve hallucination, secrets, + coordination simultaneously
- Open source = community moat (network effects)
