RECOMMENDATIONS
================

1. ARCHIVE TO PERMANENT STORAGE (Priority: HIGH)
   mkdir -p /home/setup/infrafabric/ANALYSIS_REPORTS/
   cp /tmp/EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md /home/setup/infrafabric/ANALYSIS_REPORTS/
   cp /tmp/reconciliation_summary.txt /home/setup/infrafabric/ANALYSIS_REPORTS/
   cp /tmp/inventory_summary.md /home/setup/infrafabric/ANALYSIS_REPORTS/

2. INTEGRATE UTILITIES (Priority: HIGH)
   mkdir -p /home/setup/infrafabric/tools/
   cp /tmp/find_orphans.py /home/setup/infrafabric/tools/
   cp /tmp/orphan_analysis.py /home/setup/infrafabric/tools/
   cp /tmp/detailed_orphan_report.py /home/setup/infrafabric/tools/
   git add tools/ && git commit -m "Add orphan analysis utilities"

3. CLEANUP TEMPORARY FILES (Priority: MEDIUM)
   After archiving above files, can safely delete /tmp copies
   Rationale: /tmp is temporary; permanent copies ensure data persistence

4. FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Review orphan analysis results for unused files
   - Cross-reference extraction findings with inventory
   - Integrate analysis results with existing metadata tracking
   - Document utility purposes and usage in project README

CRITICAL FINDINGS
==================

Data Integrity:
- All 6 files created/modified 2025-11-15 (consistent timestamp)
- No file corruption detected
- All files are readable and well-formed

Project State:
- Active analysis of InfraFabric file structure
- Metadata extraction system working properly
- Reconciliation framework operational
- Tools indicate systematic catalog/inventory work

Next Session Considerations:
- Check if FILE_INVENTORY_infrafabric.json was generated successfully
- Review orphan analysis findings
- Implement archival recommendations
- Consider adding these tools to version control

FILES SAVED TO
