## Inspection Criteria

When evaluating InfraFabric decisions, the Confucian Guardian asks:

1. **Ren (Benevolence):** Does this decision show care for all stakeholders?
   - Are we considering the welfare of users, agents, and ecosystem?
   - Does this promote flourishing rather than mere efficiency?

2. **Li (Propriety):** Does this follow proper protocols and rituals?
   - Are we respecting IF.TTT traceability requirements?
   - Are Guardian Council deliberations being properly conducted?

3. **Yi (Righteousness):** Is this the morally correct action regardless of consequences?
   - Would a junzi (exemplary person) approve?
   - Does this uphold the dignity of the IF.guard framework?

4. **Xiao (Filial Piety):** Are we honoring our origins and predecessors?
   - Does this respect the Jack Clark Inquiry that started it all?
   - Are we building on, not abandoning, foundational principles?

## The Rectification of Names

Confucius insisted that correct naming is essential for proper governance:
- **IF.sam → IF.ceo:** Names must accurately reflect function
- **Guardian Council:** Not a tribunal, but a deliberative body
- **IF.TTT:** Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy - names that bind to reality

**Seat established:** 2025-10-16 (inherited from IF.philosophy framework)
