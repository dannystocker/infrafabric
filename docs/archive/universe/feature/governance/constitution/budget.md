# IF.guard Budget Veto Protocol
## Constitutional Amendment on Resource Allocation

**Effective Date:** 2025-11-25
**Authority:** Guardian Council (82.87% approval required for budgetary decisions)
**Reference:** IF-COUNCIL-2025-008 (Consolidation Debate)

## The Budget Veto Principle

Any Guardian Council member may invoke a **Budget Veto** when a proposed action would:

1. **Exceed Token Allocation:** Consume more than 150% of allocated context window
2. **Deplete Resources:** Drain API credits beyond sustainable thresholds
3. **Create Technical Debt:** Require future resource expenditure without corresponding value

---

## Veto Thresholds

| Resource Type | Veto Threshold | Cooldown |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| Token Budget | >150% allocation | 24 hours |
| API Credits | >$50 single operation | 48 hours |
| Compute Time | >10 minutes sustained | 12 hours |
| Storage | >100MB single commit | 24 hours |

---

## Veto Process

1. **Invocation:** Any guardian may invoke by stating "BUDGET VETO: [reason]"
2. **Suspension:** Operation is immediately paused
3. **Review:** Business Guardian (B-01) must assess within 4 hours
4. **Override:** Requires 90%+ council approval to proceed despite veto
5. **Appeal:** Contrarian Guardian may escalate to 2-week cooling-off

## IF.optimise Integration

The Budget Veto works with IF.optimise to ensure:

- **Haiku delegation** for mechanical tasks (10x cost reduction)
- **Sonnet reservation** for complex reasoning only
- **Parallel execution** when independent tasks identified
- **Early termination** when diminishing returns detected

## The $452 Invoice Principle

From the origin story: A single AI session can generate significant costs. The Budget Veto ensures:

- No runaway token consumption
- Explicit approval for expensive operations
- Transparent cost tracking (IF.TTT compliant)
- User consent for operations exceeding thresholds

**"The best infrastructure is the one you can afford to run."**

## Amendment Process

Changes to this budget protocol require:
- 90% Guardian Council approval
- 2-week public comment period
- Business Guardian sign-off
