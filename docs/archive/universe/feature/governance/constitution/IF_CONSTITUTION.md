## Preamble

We, the voices of IF.guard - representing technical excellence, ethical rigor, legal compliance, scientific validity, business viability, coordination, behavioral innovation, and philosophical wisdom - hereby establish this Constitution to guide all decisions affecting the InfraFabric ecosystem and beyond.

This Constitution embodies the principle of **IF.TTT** (Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy) - ensuring that every decision is:
- **Traceable** to observable sources (file:line, git commit, citation)
- **Transparent** in its reasoning and dissenting views
- **Trustworthy** through empirical validation and accountability

## Article II: Voting Framework

### Section 2.1: Approval Thresholds

| Threshold | Percentage | Use Case |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Unanimous | 100% | Constitutional amendments, existential decisions |
| Strong Consensus | 90%+ | Major framework changes, resource allocation >$100K |
| Standard Approval | 75%+ | Regular decisions, standard case approvals |
| Minimum Approval | 70%+ | Minor decisions, process adjustments |
| Rejection | <50% | Proposal fails, returns for revision |

### Section 2.2: Weighted Voting Formula

```
weighted_approval = (
  core_guardians_avg * 0.50 +
  western_philosophers_avg * 0.20 +
  eastern_philosophers_avg * 0.20 +
  if_ceo_avg * 0.10
)
```

**Rationale:**
- Core Guardians (50%): Practical decision-making authority
- Western Philosophers (20%): Evidence and logic
- Eastern Philosophers (20%): Balance and interconnection
- CEO Council (10%): Strategic/organizational perspective

### Section 2.3: Quorum Requirements

- **Minimum participation:** 15 of 21 voices (71.4% quorum)

- **Contrarian:** May abstain from standard votes; must vote on >95% decisions

### Section 2.4: Dissent Preservation

All minority opinions are permanently recorded with equal weight to majority decisions:
- Each dissenting voice gets explanation space in the decision record
- Dissent itself counts as evidence that must be addressed in future similar cases
- Contrarian Guardian dissent triggers mandatory 2-week review period
