---

### Part 2: Technical Accuracy Assessment (40 points)

**2.1 IF.TTT Compliance Verification (15 points)**

For **INFRAFABRIC-NARRATIVE-STORY.md:**
- **Traceable:** Are claims linked to specific files/commits/line numbers?
- **Transparent:** Are failures disclosed? (gaps, bugs, incomplete work)
- **Trustworthy:** Are numbers verifiable? (line counts, ratings, metrics)

For **EPIC-GAMES-NARRATIVE-INTELLIGENCE-REPORT.md:**
- **Traceable:** Does every claim cite 2+ sources?

---

### Part 4: V4 Epic Version Progression Analysis (BONUS - 20 points)

This section specifically evaluates the v1 → v2 → v3 iterative improvement process documented in the comprehensive comparison.

**4.1 Version Evolution Quality (10 points)**
- Is the v1 → v2 improvement genuine? (sources 1→2, HOLD protocol added)
- Is the v2 → v3 fix critical? (ESCALATE bug legal liability)
- Are the quantitative metrics accurate? (+100% sources, +36.4% HOLD rate)
- Does the progression demonstrate methodical improvement or random changes?

**4.2 Critical Bug Analysis (10 points)**
- Is the v2 ESCALATE bug explanation technically accurate?
- Is the legal liability assessment reasonable? (hidden revenue conflicts)
- Is the v3 fix correct? (reordering if-statements)
- Does this demonstrate real software engineering rigor?

**Specific Verification Tasks:**

1. **Trace the ESCALATE bug:**
   - Read the v2 logic in the comparison document
   - Verify the bug exists: `if confidence < 0.3 → HOLD` comes before `if confidence < 0.2 → ESCALATE`
   - Confirm the fix in v3: Order reversed correctly

2. **Validate quantitative claims:**
   - Count sources in v1 vs v2 evidence tables (should be 1 → 2)
   - Calculate HOLD rate: v1 (0/N) vs v2 (X/N) - verify 36.4%
   - Calculate ESCALATE rate: v2 (0/N) vs v3 (Y/N) - verify 18.2%

3. **Assess production readiness:**
   - Does v3 meet all 8/8 criteria listed?
   - Is the 5.0/5 IF.TTT rating justified?
   - Would you deploy v3 to production? Why or why not?

**Part 4 Total:** X/20

## Special Focus Areas

### Complete Evolution Timeline (Context)

Understanding the full progression helps evaluate whether improvements are incremental or transformative:

**Philosophy Database Evolution:**
- **v1 (Start):** 12 philosophers, 75% Western, 25% Eastern - Theory only, no implementation
- **r3 (Nov 9, 2025):** 25 philosophers, 62% Western, 38% non-Western - Added 9 traditions, formal YAML
- **r4 (Nov 11, 2025):** 26 philosophers, 54% Western, 46% non-Western - Added code examples, tensions, lineage
- **Key Metric:** Time-to-implementation: 3 hours (r3) → 5 minutes (r4) = 97% reduction

**V4 Epic Intelligence Dossier Evolution:**
- **v1 (08:23:41):** Baseline - 1 source per claim, no HOLD, no ESCALATE, no contrarian view - 4.2/5
- **v2 (08:28:48):** Multi-source + HOLD - 2 sources per claim, 36.4% HOLD rate, contrarian added - 4.7/5
- **v3 (08:38:45):** ESCALATE fix - 18.2% ESCALATE rate, legal liability mitigated - 5.0/5
- **Key Metric:** IF.TTT compliance: 4.2 → 4.7 → 5.0 (perfect score achieved)

**The Narrative Question:**
Do the narrative documents accurately represent this progression, or do they over-dramatize minor changes?

4. Is the v1→v2→v3 progression genuinely iterative or artificially staged?
5. Would this document satisfy a technical peer review?

---

## Meta-Evaluation Question

**The Big Question:**

InfraFabric claims to transform "philosophy into infrastructure" and these narrative documents are supposed to demonstrate that methodology in action.

**Do these narratives successfully demonstrate:**
1. **Philosophy → Code:** Are philosophical principles operationalized?
2. **Theory → Practice:** Is the implementation gap bridged?
3. **Evidence → Story:** Is epistemological rigor maintained while telling engaging stories?
4. **IF.TTT in Action:** Do the narratives themselves embody Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy principles?

**Your verdict:** YES / PARTIALLY / NO
**Your reasoning:** [3-5 paragraphs]

- Total: ~85K tokens (well within Gemini 2M context window)

---

## Success Criteria for This Evaluation

**This evaluation is successful if it:**
1. ✅ Identifies concrete strengths (what works well)
2. ✅ Identifies concrete weaknesses (what needs improvement)
3. ✅ Provides actionable recommendations (not vague suggestions)
4. ✅ Validates or challenges IF.TTT compliance claims
5. ✅ Assesses whether narrative methodology is sound
6. ✅ Verifies v1→v2→v3 progression accuracy (quantitative metrics)
7. ✅ Evaluates ESCALATE bug technical depth and legal liability assessment
8. ✅ Gives a clear verdict: publication-ready or needs work

## Context for Gemini: What You're Evaluating

This is NOT just "documentation" - this is an attempt to:
- Transform dry technical research into compelling narratives
- Maintain perfect epistemological rigor (IF.TTT) while storytelling
- Demonstrate that "philosophy as infrastructure" is real (not just theory)
- Create models for how AI systems should communicate (transparent, traceable, trustworthy)

**The stakes:** If this works, it's a blueprint for how AI research should be communicated. If it doesn't, it's philosophy theater that wastes everyone's time.

**Your job:** Tell us which one it is, and why.

---

## Final Note

**Be brutally honest.**

We don't want validation - we want TRUTH. If something is weak, say so. If a claim is unjustified, call it out. If the narrative is boring, tell us why.

The goal is to make this work EXCELLENT, not to feel good about it.

**Gemini, your evaluation begins now. 🚀**
