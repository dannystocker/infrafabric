executive_summary:
  overall_score: 6.2
  one_liner: "Research-heavy AI governance and multi-LLM framework with almost no in-repo production code."
  key_strength: "Deep, coherent conceptual architecture with unusually strong philosophical grounding and an embedded evaluation framework."
  key_weakness: "Very little executable InfraFabric implementation in this repo; almost entirely documentation and design."
  buyer_fit: "Academic AI-safety/governance labs (8/10 fit, 3/10 willingness to pay), enterprise AI governance teams (6/10 fit, 6/10 willingness to pay if implementation exists)."
  recommended_action: "Ship a minimal reference stack for a small set of IF.* components and add tests/CI, using the embedded evaluation system to drive a short, focused hardening sprint."

  findings:
    - text: "InfraFabric offers a dense, well-structured conceptual architecture for multi-LLM governance, spanning IF.vision, IF.foundations, IF.armour, and IF.witness, plus a comprehensive Dossier."
      file: "INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11.md"
      evidence: "Cross-references between Dossier, IF.* papers, and annexes show consistent terminology and layered design."
      severity: "info"
    - text: "A curated philosophy database (13 philosophers, 29 example queries) grounds governance decisions in explicit epistemic and ethical traditions."
      file: "philosophy/IF.philosophy-database.yaml"
      evidence: "Each philosopher entry includes traditions and tags that are referenced from the IF.* texts and example query file."
      severity: "info"
    - text: "Some sections repeat similar explanations across Dossier, papers, and annexes, increasing cognitive load without adding new constraints or algorithms."
      file: "annexes/INFRAFABRIC-SOURCE-INDEX-AND-COMPONENT-STATUS.md"
      evidence: "Concepts like IF.guard councils and IF.yologuard are described in multiple places with overlapping prose."

market_analysis:
  tam_estimate: "Tens to low hundreds of millions of dollars annually across AI governance tooling, internal policy enforcement, and AI safety research support, assuming a mature implementation."
  buyer_personas:
    - rank: 1
      name: "Academic AI safety / governance research labs"
      fit_score: 9
      willingness_to_pay: 3
      rationale: "Very strong fit with their research agendas and citation culture, but budgets tend to favor grants and collaboration over software licensing."
    - rank: 2
      name: "Enterprise AI governance and compliance teams"
      fit_score: 7
      willingness_to_pay: 6
      rationale: "Clear need for policy enforcement and traceable AI behavior; InfraFabric ideas are compelling if backed by a hardened reference implementation."
    - rank: 3
      name: "LLM platform / infra vendors"
      fit_score: 5
      willingness_to_pay: 5
      rationale: "Could adopt patterns like multi-LLM orchestration and evaluation, but would likely integrate concepts into existing products rather than buying InfraFabric as-is."
  competitors:
    - name: "LangSmith (LangChain)"
      overlap: "Agent tracing, run metadata, debugging and evaluation of LLM applications."
      differentiation: "InfraFabric emphasizes epistemic governance, philosophy-backed design, and multi-LLM coordination rather than just tracing and metrics."
    - name: "Weights & Biases"
      overlap: "Experiment tracking and model evaluation infrastructure."
      differentiation: "InfraFabric focuses on agentic systems and AI governance layers, not primarily on model training experiments."
    - name: "Humanloop / other LLMops tools"
      overlap: "Prompt and evaluation management for LLM applications."
      differentiation: "InfraFabric frames evaluation as part of a broader governance fabric with philosophy and organizational design built in."
  monetization_paths:
    - strategy: "Open-core reference implementation plus governance SaaS"
      viability: 7
      timeline: "12–18 months, contingent on shipping a minimal IF.* reference stack and securing a few design partners."
    - strategy: "Consulting and custom InfraFabric implementations for safety-conscious organizations"
      viability: 8
      timeline: "Immediate; relies on expertise rather than polished product."

gaps_and_issues:
  p0_blockers:
    - issue: "Core IF.* components such as IF.guard, IF.yologuard, and IF.citate lack in-repo implementations."
      impact: "The repo cannot be used as a standalone product; users cannot run or test most of the architecture described in the documentation."
      effort: "Several weeks to months to build even minimal, well-tested implementations of a subset of components."
      files:
        - "IF-armour.md"
        - "INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11.md"
    - issue: "No automated tests or CI pipeline anywhere in the repo."
      impact: "Future code additions will be fragile and changes to evaluation scripts or data pipelines will be hard to validate."
      effort: "3–7 days to introduce basic unit tests and CI for the evaluation script and any new reference implementations."
      files:
        - "docs/evidence/merge_evaluations.py"
  p1_high_priority:
    - issue: "Ambiguous implementation status for many named components."
      impact: "External readers and collaborators cannot easily tell which parts are research-only vs. deployed elsewhere vs. missing."
      effort: "1–2 days to add an implementation status table and update README/Dossier language."
      files:
        - "README.md"
        - "INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11.md"
    - issue: "Citation and link-health audit is specified but not present as a committed artifact."
      impact: "Harder for reviewers to trust that all claims and references have actually been checked."
      effort: "2–4 days to run the audit and add a results file."
      files:
        - "docs/evidence/EVALUATION_FILES_SUMMARY.md"
  p2_medium_priority:
    - issue: "Documentation is extensive but scattered and dense, with repeated explanations across multiple files."
      impact: "Onboarding time for engineers and potential adopters is higher than necessary."
      effort: "1–2 weeks to consolidate into a shorter primary guide and move deep dives into clearly labeled appendices."
      files:
        - "INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11.md"
        - "IF-vision.md"
        - "IF-foundations.md"
    - issue: "Philosophy database is not exposed as a stable API or library."
      impact: "Reusers must copy-paste snippets or roll their own loader, which discourages reuse."
      effort: "3–5 days to publish a small Python package or module with clear API docs and tests."

  recommendations:
    - "Create a short, opinionated 'InfraFabric for practitioners' guide that sits above the Dossier and deep-dive papers."
    - "Add diagrams and concrete data-flow examples for 2–3 flagship IF.* components."
    - "Clearly tag sections as 'conceptual', 'descriptive of an external implementation', or 'implemented in this repo'."
