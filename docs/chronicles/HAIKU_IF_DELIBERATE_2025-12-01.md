# Haiku: The IF.deliberate Discovery
## Session 2025-12-01

```
Backspace, reconsider—
the machine shows how it thinks,
word by careful word.
```

**Context:** During a production debugging session, a simple question about human-like typing speed led to discovering IF.deliberate—the first AI interface to show real-time word replacement thinking. Not typo correction, but deliberate emphasis.

**Technical:** nginx configurations evolved through 6 iterations. Danny's voice DNA refined with anti-patterns. Sergio's frontend deployed to production.

**Innovation:** Making machine cognition visible builds trust. Nobody else does this. Premium module.
