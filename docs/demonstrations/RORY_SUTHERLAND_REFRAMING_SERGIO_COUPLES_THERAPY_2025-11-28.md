## INTRODUCTION: THE ALCHEMY OF REFRAMING

**RORY-PRIME (The Contrarian Ogilvy Executive):**

Right. So here's the thing that nobody in therapy seems to understand: **the problem isn't usually the problem.** The problem is how we've framed the bloody problem.

You see, Sergio's got this brilliant insight about "vibrar alto/bajo" being performatively contradictory—judging someone for vibrating low makes YOU vibrate low. Genius. But he's missing the next step, which is: **what if we reframe the entire conversation so the concept of vibration never arises?**

In advertising, we learned this decades ago. You don't solve the problem the customer thinks they have. You reframe it so they realize they had a different problem all along, and your solution suddenly becomes obvious.

Let me give you the Sutherland example: **The problem with the Eurostar train wasn't the journey time—it was the perceived boredom.** Install WiFi and supermodels serving Champagne, and suddenly nobody cares that it takes 2 hours instead of 1.5.

Translation to couples therapy: **The problem isn't that your partner doesn't listen—it's that you haven't made what you're saying worth listening to.**

Brutal? Yes. Effective? Absolutely.

## THE SEVEN FACETS OF RORY: REFRAMING FRAMEWORKS

I'm going to present this as **seven different Rorys**, each offering a distinct reframing lens for couples therapy. Think of it as having multiple behavioral economists in the room, each with a different obsession.

### FACET 1: RORY THE MARKETER
### FACET 2: RORY THE BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIST
### FACET 3: RORY THE PSYCHOLOGIST (The One Who Reads Kahneman)
### FACET 4: RORY THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST
### FACET 5: RORY THE SYSTEMS THINKER
### FACET 6: RORY THE SEMIOTICIAN (Words Create Reality)
### FACET 7: RORY THE CONTRARIAN (The Most Dangerous One)

---

## FACET 1: RORY THE MARKETER
### "Sell the Experience, Not the Product"

**Core Insight:** People don't want a relationship—they want the feelings a relationship provides.

**Bad Therapy Question (Traditional):**
> "What problems are you experiencing in your relationship?"

**Why It Fails:**
- Frames relationship as broken
- Activates loss aversion (threat response)
- Makes couple defensive
- Focuses on what's wrong, not what's desired

**Sutherland Reframe:**
> "If this relationship were a luxury brand, what would it promise customers? And what would the reviews currently say?"

**Why It Works:**
- **Externalizes the problem:** "The brand" is something you build together, not something you ARE
- **Activates aspiration:** Luxury brands are aspirational, not deficit-based
- **Creates playful distance:** Talking about "reviews" is less threatening than "you don't listen to me"
- **Makes improvement sexy:** Nobody wants to fix a broken relationship, but everyone wants to build a luxury brand

**Additional Marketer Reframes:**

| Traditional Question | Sutherland Reframe | Mechanism |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| "What's your biggest complaint about your partner?" | "If your relationship were a product, what feature would you add in Version 2.0?" | Product development > blame |
| "Why do you think you're incompatible?" | "What would make a competitor steal customers from your relationship?" | Competitive analysis > essentialism |
| "What needs to change?" | "What would make you pay MORE for this relationship?" | Value proposition > deficit |
| "Why aren't you happy?" | "What would make this relationship worth bragging about to friends?" | Social proof > introspection |

---

**ESPAÑOL (Faceta 1: Rory el Marketero)**

**Pregunta Terapéutica Mala (Tradicional):**
> "¿Qué problemas experimentan en su relación?"

**Reencuadre Sutherland:**
> "Si esta relación fuera una marca de lujo, ¿qué prometería a los clientes? ¿Y qué dirían las reseñas actualmente?"

**Por qué funciona:**
- **Externaliza el problema:** "La marca" es algo que construyen juntos, no algo que ERES
- **Activa aspiración:** Las marcas de lujo son aspiracionales, no basadas en déficit
- **Crea distancia lúdica:** Hablar de "reseñas" es menos amenazante que "no me escuchas"
- **Hace sexy la mejora:** Nadie quiere arreglar una relación rota, pero todos quieren construir una marca de lujo

---

## FACET 2: RORY THE BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIST
### "Nudge, Don't Nag"

**Core Insight:** People are terrible at predicting what will make them happy, but excellent at post-rationalization.

**The Problem with Direct Questions:**

Traditional therapy asks: "What do you want from this relationship?"

Answer: Bollocks. Complete bollocks.

Nobody knows what they want. They think they know—"I want more affection," "I want better communication"—but these are **culturally-approved scripts**, not genuine preferences.

**The Sutherland Solution: Revealed Preference, Not Stated Preference**

Don't ask what people want. **Observe what they choose.**

**Traditional Question:**
> "Do you want to spend more quality time together?"

**Revealed Preference Reframe:**
> "Last week, you had a free evening. Walk me through how you decided what to do."

**Why It Works:**
- **Bypasses social desirability bias:** They can't lie about what they actually did
- **Reveals true priorities:** Actions > intentions
- **Creates cognitive dissonance in real-time:** "I say I want quality time, but I chose Netflix alone"
- **Makes change feel like alignment:** "Let's make your choices match your stated values" is easier than "change your behavior"

**Behavioral Economics Reframe Table:**

| Bias/Heuristic | Traditional Question | Sutherland Reframe |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Loss Aversion** | "What would you like to gain in this relationship?" | "What would you be devastated to lose if you broke up tomorrow?" |
| **Present Bias** | "What do you want for your future together?" | "Imagine it's your anniversary in 6 months. What gift would signal 'we've really improved'?" |
| **Anchoring** | "On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you?" | "Think of the happiest couple you know. What percentage of that do you currently have?" |
| **Availability Heuristic** | "How often do you fight?" | "When was the last time you surprised each other in a good way?" |
| **Endowment Effect** | "What changes would improve your relationship?" | "If you had to sell your relationship to someone else, what would you emphasize in the pitch?" |

---

**ESPAÑOL (Faceta 2: Rory el Economista Conductual)**

**Problema con Preguntas Directas:**

La terapia tradicional pregunta: "¿Qué quieres de esta relación?"

Respuesta: Tonterías. Tonterías completas.

Nadie sabe lo que quiere. Piensan que saben—"quiero más afecto," "quiero mejor comunicación"—pero estos son **guiones culturalmente aprobados**, no preferencias genuinas.

**Solución Sutherland: Preferencia Revelada, No Preferencia Declarada**

| Sesgo/Heurística | Pregunta Tradicional | Reencuadre Sutherland |
|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Aversión a la Pérdida** | "¿Qué te gustaría ganar en esta relación?" | "¿Qué te devastaría perder si rompieras mañana?" |
| **Sesgo del Presente** | "¿Qué quieren para su futuro juntos?" | "Imagina que es su aniversario en 6 meses. ¿Qué regalo señalaría 'realmente hemos mejorado'?" |

---

## FACET 3: RORY THE PSYCHOLOGIST
### "System 1 vs. System 2: Interview the Elephant, Not the Rider"

**Core Insight:** Kahneman taught us we have two systems—fast intuitive (System 1) and slow deliberative (System 2). Traditional therapy interviews System 2, which is a PR spokesperson for the unconscious.

**The Problem:**

When you ask, "Why did you get angry at your partner?", you're asking System 2 (the rational storyteller) to explain System 1 (the emotional reactor). System 2 doesn't know—it just makes up a plausible story.

**Example:**

**Traditional:** "Why did you snap at your partner when they asked about dinner?"

**Answer (System 2 confabulation):** "Because they always expect me to decide everything and it's exhausting."

**Actual Reason (System 1 truth):** You were hangry, you'd had a bad day at work, and the question triggered loss aversion because deciding = risk of getting it wrong.

**Sutherland's Solution: Interview System 1 Directly**

Don't ask "why." Ask "when."

**Reframe:**
> "What were you doing in the 10 minutes before you snapped? Walk me through your physical state—were you hungry, tired, stressed about something else?"

**Why It Works:**
- **Bypasses confabulation:** System 1 can't lie about physiology
- **Reveals patterns:** "Oh, I ALWAYS snap when I'm hungry" is actionable
- **Removes blame:** "I'm not a bad person, I'm just poorly timed"
- **Creates practical solution:** "We solve this with snacks, not with deep psychological work"

**System 1/System 2 Reframe Table:**

| System 2 Question (Asks for story) | System 1 Question (Reveals state) |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "Why do you avoid conflict?" | "What physical sensations do you notice when disagreement begins?" |
| "What makes you love your partner?" | "When do you smile when they walk in the room vs. when don't you?" |
| "Why don't you initiate sex more often?" | "What time of day do you feel most energized? When do you feel depleted?" |
| "What's your attachment style?" | "Describe the last time you felt safe with someone. Where were you? What were you doing?" |

---

**ESPAÑOL (Faceta 3: Rory el Psicólogo)**

**Problema:**

Cuando preguntas "¿Por qué te enojaste con tu pareja?", le estás preguntando al Sistema 2 (el narrador racional) que explique el Sistema 1 (el reactor emocional). El Sistema 2 no sabe—solo inventa una historia plausible.

**Solución Sutherland: Entrevistar al Sistema 1 Directamente**

No preguntes "por qué." Pregunta "cuándo."

**Reencuadre:**
> "¿Qué estabas haciendo en los 10 minutos antes de explotar? Guíame por tu estado físico—¿tenías hambre, cansancio, estrés por otra cosa?"

---

## FACET 4: RORY THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST
### "We're Barely Different from Chimps—Plan Accordingly"

**Core Insight:** Humans evolved for small tribes of 150 people, not modern monogamous nuclear families. Our brains are running Stone Age software on 21st-century hardware.

**The Problem with Modern Relationship Expectations:**

We expect our romantic partner to be:
1. Our best friend
2. Our co-parent
3. Our financial partner
4. Our emotional support system
5. Our sexual fantasy
6. Our intellectual equal
7. Our adventure companion
8. Our domestic co-manager

**Evolutionarily, this is insane.** In ancestral environments, these roles were distributed across a tribe. Now we've crammed all of them into one person and wonder why they're "not meeting our needs."

**Traditional Therapy Question:**
> "What needs aren't being met in your relationship?"

**Evolutionary Reframe:**
> "If you lived in a tribe of 150 people, which of your current complaints would be solved by having access to more people?"

**Why This Works:**

- **Reveals unrealistic expectations:** "Oh, my partner doesn't want to discuss philosophy for 3 hours? Maybe I need a philosophy friend, not a different partner."
- **Validates normal limitations:** "It's not that they're broken—they're human."
- **Creates permission for distributed intimacy:** "I can get intellectual stimulation from book club and sexual intimacy from my partner."
- **Reduces betrayal narrative:** "They're not failing me—I've asked them to be 7 people."

**Evolutionary Reframes:**

| Modern Expectation | Evolutionary Reality | Reframe Question |
|--------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| "My partner should meet all my emotional needs" | Emotional support was distributed across kin network | "Which emotional needs could friends/family handle?" |
| "We should do everything together" | Tribes had gender-segregated activities | "What if you had 'me' activities and 'us' activities?" |
| "We should never be attracted to others" | Humans are mildly polygynous/polyandrous | "What if attraction to others is normal, but acting on it is a choice?" |
| "Our sex life should always be passionate" | Sex evolved for reproduction, not recreation | "What if maintenance sex is as legitimate as passionate sex?" |

---

**ESPAÑOL (Faceta 4: Rory el Biólogo Evolutivo)**

**Problema con Expectativas Modernas de Relación:**

Esperamos que nuestra pareja romántica sea:
1. Nuestro mejor amigo
2. Nuestro co-padre
3. Nuestro socio financiero
4. Nuestro sistema de apoyo emocional
5. Nuestra fantasía sexual
6. Nuestro igual intelectual
7. Nuestro compañero de aventuras
8. Nuestro co-gestor doméstico

**Evolutivamente, esto es una locura.** En entornos ancestrales, estos roles estaban distribuidos en una tribu. Ahora los hemos comprimido todos en una persona y nos preguntamos por qué "no satisfacen nuestras necesidades."

**Reencuadre Evolutivo:**
> "Si vivieras en una tribu de 150 personas, ¿cuáles de tus quejas actuales se resolverían teniendo acceso a más personas?"

---

## FACET 5: RORY THE SYSTEMS THINKER
### "Optimize the System, Not the Components"

**Core Insight:** Relationships are systems with feedback loops. Traditional therapy optimizes individuals. Sutherland optimizes the interaction design.

**The Thermostat Analogy:**

A thermostat doesn't make the house warmer by "trying harder." It creates a feedback system:
1. Measure temperature
2. Compare to target
3. Activate heating/cooling
4. Repeat

Most couples therapy is like telling the thermostat to "be more authentic" or "communicate its feelings about cold." **Useless.**

Instead: **Design the system so desired behavior is the path of least resistance.**

**Traditional Question:**
> "How can you both improve your communication?"

**Systems Reframe:**
> "What would need to change about your environment to make good communication automatic?"

**Examples:**

**Problem:** "We never talk anymore."

**Traditional Fix:** "Schedule weekly check-ins."

**Systems Fix:** "What if you installed a bar in your kitchen, so when cooking dinner you're automatically positioned face-to-face instead of side-by-side? Conversation becomes architectural default."

---

**Problem:** "We fight about household chores."

**Traditional Fix:** "Create a chore chart and hold each other accountable."

**Systems Fix:** "What if you hired a cleaner for £100/month? You'd spend that much on therapy anyway, and it removes the entire conflict vector. The problem isn't communication—it's that you're both exhausted and resentful about cleaning."

---

**Problem:** "We don't have sex anymore."

**Traditional Fix:** "Discuss your intimacy needs and schedule sex."

**Systems Fix:** "When DO you have sex? What conditions made it happen? Recreate those conditions instead of trying to manufacture desire from nothing."

**Systems Thinking Reframes:**

| Individual Optimization (Therapy Standard) | System Optimization (Sutherland) |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| "Learn to manage your anger better" | "Identify anger triggers and redesign environment to avoid them" |
| "Be more vulnerable with your partner" | "Create weekly low-stakes vulnerability opportunities (shared bath, long walk)" |
| "Communicate your needs clearly" | "What signal could you send that's impossible to misinterpret?" |
| "Practice active listening" | "Sit facing each other with no phones for 20 minutes—listening becomes automatic" |

---

**ESPAÑOL (Faceta 5: Rory el Pensador de Sistemas)**

**Analogía del Termostato:**

Un termostato no hace que la casa sea más cálida "esforzándose más." Crea un sistema de retroalimentación. La mayoría de la terapia de parejas es como decirle al termostato que "sea más auténtico" o "comunique sus sentimientos sobre el frío." **Inútil.**

En su lugar: **Diseñar el sistema para que el comportamiento deseado sea el camino de menor resistencia.**

---

## FACET 6: RORY THE SEMIOTICIAN
### "Words Create Reality—Choose Different Words"

**Core Insight:** The language we use shapes the reality we experience. Sergio understands this (his critique of "vibrar alto/bajo"), but doesn't go far enough.

**The Power of Framing:**

"My partner doesn't listen to me" creates:
- Victim (you)
- Villain (partner)
- Deficit narrative (something is wrong)
- Static trait ("doesn't listen" = enduring property)

**Sutherland Reframe:** "I haven't yet made what I'm saying worth interrupting Netflix for."

Now you have:
- Agency (you can make it more interesting)
- Challenge (make it worth listening to)
- Growth narrative (you're building a skill)
- Dynamic possibility (this can change)

**The Vocabulary Test:**

Replace every relationship complaint with a design challenge:

| Complaint (Deficit Language) | Design Challenge (Agency Language) |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| "They don't respect me" | "How can I signal higher value?" |
| "We've grown apart" | "What shared interest haven't we explored yet?" |
| "They're not romantic anymore" | "What would make romance feel effortless for them?" |
| "We can't agree on anything" | "What decision framework would make disagreement productive?" |
| "They take me for granted" | "How can I make my presence feel like an event rather than furniture?" |

**The Semiotic Reframes for Therapy:**

**Traditional:** "Tell me about your relationship problems."

**Sutherland:** "What would your relationship be called if it were a novel? What genre? Who are the main characters?"

**Why:** Metaphor bypasses defensiveness and activates creativity.

---

**Traditional:** "What's your biggest fear about this relationship?"

**Sutherland:** "If this relationship were a business, what would be the risk that keeps you up at night?"

**Why:** Business risk is less threatening than emotional vulnerability.

---

**ESPAÑOL (Faceta 6: Rory el Semiótico)**

**Poder del Encuadre:**

"Mi pareja no me escucha" crea:
- Víctima (tú)
- Villano (pareja)
- Narrativa de déficit (algo está mal)
- Rasgo estático ("no escucha" = propiedad duradera)

**Reencuadre Sutherland:** "Aún no he hecho que lo que digo valga la pena interrumpir Netflix."

Ahora tienes:
- Agencia (puedes hacerlo más interesante)
- Desafío (hazlo digno de escuchar)
- Narrativa de crecimiento (estás construyendo una habilidad)
- Posibilidad dinámica (esto puede cambiar)

---

## FACET 7: RORY THE CONTRARIAN
### "The Most Dangerous Rory—Questions Everything"

**Core Insight:** What if the entire premise of couples therapy is wrong?

**Contrarian Thesis #1: Most Relationship Problems Are Actually Logistics Problems**

"We fight all the time" = We're both exhausted, commuting 90 minutes, surviving on terrible food, and have no social support.

**Solution:** Don't fix the relationship. Fix the logistics. Move closer to work. Hire help. Eat better.

**Traditional Therapy:** 12 weeks of exploring your attachment wounds.

**Sutherland:** £200/month on a cleaner and meal delivery service.

**Which is more effective?** I'm betting on logistics.

---

**Contrarian Thesis #2: Maybe You're Just Incompatible and That's Fine**

Nobody tells you this, but: **Some people just aren't compatible, and no amount of therapy will fix it.**

If you want 5 kids and they want 0, you're not "failing to communicate"—you have **genuinely incompatible life visions.**

**Traditional Therapy:** "Let's explore the roots of your differing desires."

**Sutherland:** "You have two options: (1) One of you compromises and resents it forever, or (2) You break up amicably and find compatible partners. Which sounds better?"

Brutal honesty > false hope.

---

**Contrarian Thesis #3: Relationships Aren't Supposed to Make You Happy**

Happiness is an 18th-century Enlightenment invention. For 99% of human history, marriage was about:
- Economic partnership
- Reproduction
- Survival

Modern expectation: "My partner should make me deeply fulfilled."

Evolutionary reality: "My partner should not actively threaten my survival."

**Reframe:** What if a relationship is meant to be **functional**, not magical?

**Traditional:** "We've lost the spark."

**Sutherland:** "What if the spark was never meant to last? What if contentment and reliability are the actual goal?"

---

**Contrarian Reframe Table:**

| Sacred Cow of Therapy | Sutherland Contrarian Take |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| "Communication is the foundation of relationship success" | "Most happy couples don't talk much—they've just designed compatible routines" |
| "You need to work on yourselves individually before the relationship can improve" | "Or, hear me out: hire a cleaner and take a vacation" |
| "Conflict is healthy" | "Conflict is exhausting. Avoiding conflict through good design is genius." |
| "You should be your authentic self" | "Your 'authentic self' is probably annoying. Be your best self instead." |
| "Love languages are important" | "Or just ask them what they want instead of making them take a quiz" |

---

**ESPAÑOL (Faceta 7: Rory el Contrario)**

**Tesis Contraria #1: La Mayoría de los Problemas de Relación son en Realidad Problemas Logísticos**

"Peleamos todo el tiempo" = Ambos estamos agotados, viajando 90 minutos, sobreviviendo con comida terrible y sin apoyo social.

**Solución:** No arregles la relación. Arregla la logística. Múdate más cerca del trabajo. Contrata ayuda. Come mejor.

**Terapia Tradicional:** 12 semanas explorando tus heridas de apego.

**Sutherland:** €200/mes en limpiador y servicio de entrega de comidas.

**¿Cuál es más efectivo?** Apuesto por la logística.

## MASTERCLASS: APPLYING ALL 7 FACETS TO A REAL COUPLES THERAPY SCENARIO

**Scenario:** Couple comes to therapy. Woman says: "He never initiates sex anymore. I feel unwanted."

**Let's watch all 7 Rorys tackle this:**

---

### RORY #1 (MARKETER): "Sell the Experience"

**Question:** "If sex were a product you're trying to sell to him, what would make it irresistible? And right now, what's the 'cost' of saying yes—what does he have to give up or deal with?"

**Insight:** Maybe the "cost" is performance anxiety, exhaustion, or feeling inadequate. Make sex lower-cost (no performance pressure) and higher-reward (more playful, less serious).

---

### RORY #2 (BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIST): "Revealed Preference"

**Question:** "When was the last time he DID initiate? What was different that day—what was happening in his life, his stress level, his energy?"

**Insight:** Maybe he only initiates when he's well-rested and not stressed about work. **The problem isn't desire—it's depletion.** Solution: Improve his baseline energy (sleep, exercise, less work stress).

---

### RORY #3 (PSYCHOLOGIST): "Interview System 1"

**Question:** "When you think about initiating sex, what physical sensations come up? Where in your body do you feel them?"

**Insight:** Maybe he feels tightness in his chest (anxiety) or heaviness (fatigue). **The block isn't psychological—it's physiological.** Solution: Address the stress/fatigue first.

---

### RORY #4 (EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST): "Stone Age Brain"

**Question:** "Men evolved to initiate when they felt status, energy, and low stress. Has anything changed in the last 6 months that affected his sense of status or energy?"

**Insight:** Maybe he got passed over for a promotion, or they had a baby and he feels like a failure as a provider. **His sex drive isn't about attraction—it's about feeling competent.** Solution: Rebuild his sense of status/competence in other domains first.

---

### RORY #5 (SYSTEMS THINKER): "Optimize the System"

**Question:** "What if, instead of waiting for him to initiate, you created a system where initiation doesn't require willpower? For example: Every Friday night is date night, and whoever picks the restaurant initiates afterward. No discussion needed—it's automatic."

**Insight:** **Remove the decision cost.** Initiation requires activation energy. System design removes that requirement.

---

### RORY #6 (SEMIOTICIAN): "Change the Language"

**Question:** "What if we stop using 'initiate sex' and instead say 'send a signal'? What signals could he send that require less vulnerability—like lighting a candle, or putting on specific music—that you'd both understand?"

**Insight:** **"Initiate" sounds like a performance.** "Send a signal" sounds like a game. Lower the stakes.

---

### RORY #7 (CONTRARIAN): "Nuke the Premise"

**Question:** "What if the problem isn't that he doesn't initiate, but that you've both accepted a sexual script where initiation = his job? What if you initiated every time for a month and see what happens?"

**Insight:** Maybe **the real issue is role rigidity,** not desire. Break the pattern entirely.

## SYNTHESIS: THE SUTHERLAND METHOD FOR COUPLES THERAPY

After analyzing all 7 facets, here's the unified framework:

### THE 5 SUTHERLAND PRINCIPLES FOR THERAPEUTIC REFRAMING

#### 1. **REFRAME FROM DEFICIT TO DESIGN**

Don't ask: "What's broken?"
Ask: "What would make the desired behavior automatic?"

#### 2. **INTERVIEW BEHAVIOR, NOT BELIEFS**

Don't ask: "Why do you think you feel this way?"
Ask: "When did you last NOT feel this way? What was different?"

#### 3. **EXTERNALIZE THE PROBLEM**

Don't ask: "What's wrong with you/your partner?"
Ask: "If this relationship were a product/brand/system, what would need redesigning?"

#### 4. **OPTIMIZE FOR REVEALED PREFERENCE, NOT STATED VALUES**

Don't ask: "What do you want?"
Ask: "What did you actually do with your last free hour?"

#### 5. **REDUCE FRICTION, DON'T INCREASE WILLPOWER**

Don't ask: "How can you try harder?"
Ask: "What would make trying unnecessary?"

## THE REFRAMING TOOLKIT: 50 SUTHERLAND QUESTIONS FOR SERGIO

Here's the practical toolkit—50 reframed questions organized by common therapy scenarios:

### SECTION 1: COMMUNICATION ISSUES

| # | Traditional | Sutherland Reframe |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | "Why don't you communicate better?" | "What medium—text, voice memo, letter—makes hard conversations easier for you?" |
| 2 | "What's preventing honest communication?" | "If you had to communicate through a lawyer (zero emotion, just facts), what would you say?" |
| 3 | "How can you express your needs?" | "What would make stating a need feel as low-stakes as ordering coffee?" |
| 4 | "Why do you avoid difficult conversations?" | "What percentage of difficult conversations go badly? What percentage go well?" |

|---|-------------|-------------------|
| 21 | "Do you feel supported?" | "When's the last time your partner surprised you by handling something you dreaded?" |
| 22 | "What emotional needs aren't being met?" | "Which emotional needs could be met by friends instead of partner?" |
| 23 | "How can your partner support you better?" | "If your partner could read your mind for one day, what would they discover?" |
| 24 | "Do you feel heard?" | "If your partner had to summarize your biggest concern right now, could they?" |
| 25 | "What makes you feel loved?" | "When do you feel most appreciated—after you've done something or just existing?" |

### SECTION 6: PRACTICAL/LOGISTICS

| # | Traditional | Sutherland Reframe |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| 26 | "How do you divide household labor?" | "What's one chore that would improve your mood 30% if you never did it again?" |
| 27 | "Are you carrying mental load fairly?" | "If you hired someone to handle [X], would resentment decrease?" |

| 31 | "Do you feel like yourself in this relationship?" | "What percentage of 'you' existed before this relationship that doesn't exist now?" |
| 32 | "Have you lost your identity?" | "If you had one 'selfish' day per month with zero guilt, what would you do?" |
| 33 | "Do you have enough independence?" | "What would you do if your partner disappeared for 24 hours with no notice?" |

## CONCLUSION: THE SUTHERLAND MANIFESTO FOR SERGIO

Right. So here's what I want Sergio to take away from all this:

### 1. **STOP ASKING "WHY"—START ASKING "WHEN"**

"Why" triggers confabulation. "When" reveals patterns.

### 2. **OPTIMIZE THE SYSTEM, NOT THE PERSON**

Don't fix the couple. Fix the logistics, architecture, and incentives.

### 3. **REFRAME FROM DEFICIT TO DESIGN**

"What's broken?" → "What could be better designed?"

### 4. **INTERVIEW REVEALED PREFERENCE, NOT STATED VALUES**

What people DO reveals truth. What people SAY reveals aspiration.

### 5. **REDUCE FRICTION INSTEAD OF INCREASING WILLPOWER**

Willpower is finite. Systems are infinite.

### 6. **EXTERNALIZE THE PROBLEM USING METAPHOR**

Talk about the relationship as a brand, product, business, or novel. Bypasses defensiveness.

### 7. **CHALLENGE SACRED COWS**

Maybe the problem isn't lack of communication. Maybe it's exhaustion.
Maybe the problem isn't incompatibility. Maybe it's logistics.
Maybe the problem isn't them. Maybe it's you asking the wrong question.

**The Rory Sutherland Guarantee:**

If you reframe every therapy question using these 7 lenses, one of three things will happen:

1. **The couple will solve their problem faster** (because you've reframed it into something actionable)
2. **The couple will realize they don't actually have a problem** (because the problem was linguistic, not real)
3. **The couple will realize they're genuinely incompatible and should break up** (and that's fine—brutal honesty > false hope)

Any of those outcomes is better than 6 months of "exploring your attachment wounds" while the real problem is that you're both exhausted and need a cleaner.
