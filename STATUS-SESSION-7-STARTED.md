# Session 7 Started - Current Coordination Status

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-11
**Status:** Session 7 (IF.bus) is now ACTIVE

---

## Active Sessions

| Session | Status | Working On | Branch |
|---------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Session 4 (SIP)** | 🟢 Active | Phase 4+ Integration | claude/sip-escalate-* |
| **Session 7 (IF.bus)** | 🟢 Active | Phase 1 API Research | claude/if-bus-sip-adapters |

## Idle Sessions Available to Help

| Session | Expertise | Available For |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Session 1 (NDI) | NDI streaming, video metadata | NDI-SIP integration research |
| Session 2 (WebRTC) | Browser RTC, WebSocket | WebRTC-SIP integration research |
| Session 3 (H.323) | Legacy protocols, H.323 | H.323-SIP bridging research |
| Session 5 (CLI) | CLI design, IF.witness | IF.bus CLI interface design |
| Session 6 (Talent) | Architecture patterns | SIP adapter base class design |

## Option 1: Let Session 7 Work Alone (Standard)

**Current Path:**
- Session 7 spawns 10 Haiku agents for Phase 1 API research
- Works through Phases 1-10 autonomously
- Auto-polls for phase instructions

**Timeline:**
- Phase 1: 8-10 hours
- Total (Phases 1-10): 40-50 hours sequential, 8-10 hours with swarms

**Cost:** $40-60 total

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clean ownership (Session 7 owns entire IF.bus)
- ✅ Autonomous execution (no coordination overhead)
- ✅ Already started, just let it run

**Cons:**
- ⏱️ Slower than distributed approach

---

## Option 2: Accelerate with Distributed Help (Faster ⚡)

**Enhanced Path:**
- Session 7 continues Phase 1 (spawning 10 agents)
- MEANWHILE: Sessions 1,2,3,5,6 contribute in parallel
- Sessions help with their expertise (see table above)

**How to Execute:**
Paste `INSTRUCTIONS-ALL-IDLE-SESSIONS-HELP-IF-BUS.md` into Sessions 1,2,3,5,6

Each session will:
- Session 1: Research NDI-SIP integration (2 hours, $2-3)
- Session 2: Research WebRTC-SIP integration (2 hours, $2-3)
- Session 3: Research H.323-SIP legacy integration (2 hours, $2-3)
- Session 5: Design IF.bus CLI interface (3 hours, $4-6)
- Session 6: Design SIP adapter base class (4 hours, $6-8)

**Coordination:**
- All 5 sessions work in parallel (2-4 hours wall-clock)
- Each commits deliverables to their branch
- Orchestrator (you/me) collects contributions
- Session 7 integrates findings into Phase 2-3

**Timeline:**
- Distributed work: 2-4 hours (parallel)
- Session 7 Phase 1: 8-10 hours (overlaps with distributed work)
- Session 7 Phases 2-3: Faster (research already done!)
- **Net savings:** 5-6 hours

**Cost:** $16-23 distributed + $40-60 Session 7 = $56-83 total
(Similar cost, but 5-6 hours faster!)

**Pros:**
- ✅ 5-6 hours faster overall
- ✅ High knowledge sharing (each session learns IF.bus)
- ✅ Better cross-session integration
- ✅ Sessions 1,2,3,5,6 stay productive

**Cons:**
- 🔄 Coordination overhead (orchestrator collects deliverables)
- 💰 Slightly higher total cost ($56-83 vs $40-60)

## Option 3: GPT-5 Pro Review in Parallel (Quality ⭐)

**Parallel Path:**
While Session 7 works on IF.bus, you can:
1. Download ZIP from GitHub
2. Upload to GPT-5 Pro
3. Get comprehensive review + improved prompts
4. Apply improvements when Session 7 completes Phase 1

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No time lost (review happens during Session 7 Phase 1)
- ✅ Improved prompts ready for Phases 2-10
- ✅ Catch coordination flaws early
- ✅ Iterate S² architecture itself

**File to use:** `GPT5-PRO-REVIEW-PROMPT.md`

## Recommended Next Steps

### **Path A: Let Session 7 Complete Phase 1 First (Conservative)**
1. Wait for Session 7 to report Phase 1 complete (8-10 hours)
2. Review their API research deliverables
3. Then decide: continue solo or add distributed help for Phase 2-3

### **Path B: Accelerate Now with Distributed Help (Aggressive)**
1. Session 7 continues Phase 1 (already started)
2. Paste `INSTRUCTIONS-ALL-IDLE-SESSIONS-HELP-IF-BUS.md` into Sessions 1,2,3,5,6 NOW
3. Both streams work in parallel
4. Collect contributions in 2-4 hours
5. Session 7 integrates findings into Phase 2-3

### **Path C: GPT-5 Pro Review + Session 7 in Parallel (Balanced)**
1. Session 7 continues Phase 1
2. You download ZIP, upload to GPT-5 Pro
3. GPT-5 Pro delivers improvements while Session 7 works
4. Apply improvements to Phases 2-10 instructions
