## PHASE 1: PARTNERSHIP CONTACT (Dec 9)

### Objective
Initiate partnership discussion with Georges-Antoine Gary via structured conversation call.

### Pre-Call Preparation (Dec 8)

**Timing:** 1 hour before call

1. **Call Briefing Review**
   - Read RAPPORT-POUR-GEORGES-ANTOINE-GARY.md (30 KB) - main presentation
   - Skim GEDIMAT-CONFIDENCE-FRAMEWORK.md (14 KB) - reference
   - Review GEORGES-ANTOINE-GARY-COMPREHENSIVE-PROFILE.md - his context
   - Understand success criteria: Board-ready presentation, clear ROI, partnership appetite

2. **Materials Organization**
   - Have RAPPORT PDF ready to send after call
   - Have demo walkthrough outline (DEMO-EXECUTION-SUMMARY.md) accessible
   - Have pilot protocol ready for discussion
   - Prepare 3-scenario financial model explanation

3. **Call Setup**
   - Schedule 60-minute call (allows 45 min discussion + 15 min logistics)
   - Ensure quiet environment
   - Have video enabled (relationship building)
   - Have all materials visible but don't screen-share initially

### Call Structure (60 minutes)

**00:00-05:00 (Warmup & Context)**
- "Georges, thank you for taking time today. We've spent 3 weeks researching your positioning and market opportunity."
- "We found something interesting: Your 2021 'AI Augmented' positioning is psychologically smart and ahead of the market."
- "This conversation is about testing whether there's partnership potential between InfraFabric and your PR/communications business."

**05:00-25:00 (Insight Presentation)**
- "Your positioning aligns with 3 behavioral principles that explain why clients trust you" (Illusion of Control, Status-Quo Bias, Costly Signaling)
- "We've analyzed the French B2B market and identified a specific 14-day pilot structure that proves ROI"
- "The economic case is strong: €210K net annual benefit with transparent, measurable path"
- "But here's the honest part: This works only if you believe the methodology. We'd rather lose a bad fit than win with misalignment."

**25:00-45:00 (Interactive Discussion)**
- "What's your reaction to the behavioral grounding?"
- "Does the financial model match your understanding of client economics?"
- "What would success look like for you in a partnership?"
- "What concerns do you have about the approach?"

**45:00-55:00 (Demo Walkthrough)**
- "Let me show you exactly how we'd structure the 14-day pilot with your first client"
- Share DEMO-WALKTHROUGH-FOR-EXECUTIVES.md (executive summary)
- Show the weekly gate structure: Week 1 (baseline confirmed) → Week 2 (operational) → Week 3 (40-70% reduction) → Week 4 (decision)

**55:00-60:00 (Next Steps)**
- "Here's what we propose: You take the RAPPORT home, we schedule a 30-minute technical walkthrough, then we move forward or part ways"
- "Either way, the research is transparent and available"
- Confirm Dec 10-15 demo window (if interested)

### Success Criteria for Dec 9 Call

✅ **Minimum Success:** Georges agrees to review RAPPORT, schedule Dec 10-15 demo
- Indicates genuine interest
- Moves from "prospect" to "engaged potential partner"
- Allows technical deep-dive in demo phase

✅ **Strong Success:** Georges expresses enthusiasm, asks about pilot client, discusses timeline
- Indicates leadership appetite
- Partnership probability 75-85%

✅ **Exceptional Success:** Georges identifies specific client to pilot with, discusses Q1 2026 expansion
- Indicates active buy-in
- Partnership probability 85%+

❌ **Failure:** Georges cites misalignment concerns or delays review
- Triggers re-evaluation of approach
- May indicate need for additional positioning work

---

## PHASE 2: DEMO WALKTHROUGH (Dec 10-15)

### Objective
Technical deep-dive into pilot methodology and execution protocols.

### If Georges Accepts (Probability: 70-80%)

**Demo Schedule:** 90-minute interactive session

**Logistics:**
- Confirm exact date/time (Georges' preference)
- Video call preferred (screen-sharing for data visualization)
- Have DEMO-WALKTHROUGH-FOR-EXECUTIVES.md as presentation
- Prepare spreadsheet: 3-scenario financial model with sensitivity analysis

**Demo Content (90 min):**

1. **00:00-10:00: Financial Model Deep-Dive**
   - Show cost calculation: Base API Spend × Context Redundancy × Application Rate - Implementation Cost = Net Benefit
   - Example: €400K × 70% × 90% - €42K = €210K/year base case
   - Show 3 scenarios: Conservative (€100K), Base (€210K), Optimistic (€250K)
   - Show caveats: "These are projections; we measure actual on Day 7"

2. **10:00-30:00: Pilot Protocol Walkthrough**
   - Week 1: System audit (measure current context redundancy)
   - Week 2: Deployment (implement optimization layer)
   - Week 3: Performance measurement (measure actual reduction vs. baseline)
   - Week 4: Decision gates (proceed to partnership or analyze why not)
   - Each gate has explicit success criteria and measurement protocol

3. **30:00-50:00: Client Selection & Readiness**
   - "Which of your clients fit the pilot profile?"
   - Profile: €300K-€500K annual API spend, multi-API architecture, open to measurement
   - Create shortlist of 1-3 candidates
   - Discuss communication approach (how will you present this to them?)

4. **50:00-75:00: Operational Execution**
   - Who on Georges' side owns the relationship? (technical contact)
   - What's the decision-making timeline?
   - How will you communicate results internally?
   - Risk mitigation: What if we don't hit the 40-70% reduction target?

5. **75:00-90:00: Partnership Terms & Timeline**
   - If pilot succeeds (Dec 17-31): 14-day cycle, measure real savings
   - If client sees value (Jan 1): Move to partnership discussion
   - Partnership structure: Revenue share? Engagement model? Exclusivity?
   - Q1 2026 rollout timeline (if successful)

### If Georges Declines Demo (Probability: 20-30%)

**Response Strategy:**
- "Thank you for the consideration. The door is open if your position changes."
- "Can you share what felt like misalignment? We want to improve our approach."
- Exit gracefully but collect feedback for future iterations
- Document learnings in SESSION-RESUME for next instance

---

## PHASE 3: PILOT EXECUTION (Dec 17+ if Green-Light)

### Timeline (If Partnership Moves Forward)

**Week 1 (Dec 17-21): System Audit**
- Baseline data collection with Georges' chosen client
- Measure current API context redundancy
- Success metric: Baseline established with ±10% confidence

**Week 2 (Dec 24-28): Deployment & Tuning**
- Implement optimization layer
- Validate no disruption to client operations
- Success metric: System operational, first cost tracking working

**Week 3 (Dec 31-Jan 4): Performance Measurement**
- Measure actual context redundancy reduction
- Compare to baseline (target: 40-70%)
- Success metric: Achieved reduction ≥40% or clear technical reason if not

**Week 4 (Jan 7-11): Partnership Decision**
- Review results with Georges and client
- Discuss partnership scope: Which clients? Which frequency? Which compensation?
- Go/no-go decision: Expand to additional clients or analyze why not?

## COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

### Dec 9 Contact Email (Pre-Call)

```
Subject: Partnership Conversation - InfraFabric & [Georges' Company Name]

Hi Georges,

Over the past 3 weeks, we've researched your positioning and market opportunity in B2B communications. We've found something interesting: your 2021 "AI Augmented" positioning is psychologically defensible and ahead of the market.

We'd like to explore whether there's partnership potential between InfraFabric and your communications business. We're suggesting a 60-minute conversation on [DATE/TIME] to discuss:

1. Your positioning strategy (behavioral grounding)
2. A specific 14-day pilot structure with transparent ROI measurement
3. Partnership potential if the economics align

The conversation is exploratory—we'd rather identify misalignment early than commit to a bad fit.

Attached: High-level overview of our findings
Meeting link: [ZOOM/TEAMS]

Looking forward,
[Name]
InfraFabric
```

### Dec 9 Post-Call Follow-Up (If Positive)

```
Subject: RAPPORT & Demo Scheduling - Next Steps

Hi Georges,

Thank you for the thoughtful conversation today. We appreciated your [specific feedback point].

As discussed, here's the 30-page RAPPORT we developed during research. It covers:
- Behavioral psychology grounding (Langer, Kahneman, Zahavi)
- Financial quantification (€210K net annual benefit case)
- 14-day pilot structure with explicit success metrics
- Reusable framework for future client partnerships

Next step: Technical deep-dive demo (90 min) walking through pilot execution.

Availability: Dec 10-15 (your preference)
Link: [ZOOM/TEAMS]

Please review RAPPORT at your pace and let me know if you have questions.

Best,
[Name]
```

## CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If Georges Says "No" to Dec 9 Call

1. **Ask for Specific Feedback**
   - "What aspect felt like misalignment?"
   - "Is this 'not now' or 'not ever'?"
   - "What would change your mind?"

2. **Document Learning**
   - Add findings to SESSION-RESUME for next instance
   - Consider: Positioning adjustment needed? Research depth issue? Timing problem?

3. **Keep Door Open**

   - Maintain professional relationship
   - No burn-bridges approach

### If Demo Goes Poorly

1. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Was it technical concerns? (Fix with deeper data)
   - Was it fit concerns? (Pivot positioning)
   - Was it timeline concerns? (Adjust rollout schedule)

2. **Offer Alternative Path**
   - "What would make this work for you?"
   - "Can we pilot with a different client profile?"
   - "Should we revisit this after you've had time to think?"

3. **Preserve Learning**
   - Document what worked and what didn't
   - Share with next instance for continuous improvement
