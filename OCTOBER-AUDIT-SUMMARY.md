## Key Finding

**Instance #0 has captured only ~12% of the October origin material**

The 2 fully archived conversations (Seeking confirmation + Claude swearing) are excellent, but they're missing the crucial specifications, market strategy, and competitive analysis conversations that happened Oct 27-31.

**To complete Instance #0 preservation:** Extract the 23 missing conversations, particularly:
1. InfraFabric overview (complete spec)
2. Unzip and explain (first pitch test)
3. Prospect outreach letter (market strategy)

These 3 files alone (2.3 MB) represent the "what" and "why" that complements the philosophical "why" already captured.
