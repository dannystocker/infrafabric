BEFORE/AFTER KEY EXAMPLES
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: Comparison Table
BEFORE: "Instead of generic RLHF, we embedded the specific professional 
         voice of Sergio de Vocht..."
         (No visual comparison, hidden in dense prose)

AFTER:  | Aspect | Cold AI (Safety Nanny) | IF.emotion |
        |--------|----------------------|-----------|
        | Architecture | Prompt + guardrails | **307 citations** + 20-voice + IF.TTT |
        | Validation | None (hope it works) | **2 validations, 0 errors** |
        | Speed | Instant (inhuman) | **6x speed** (visible thinking) |
        
        (Clear visual comparison, metrics bolded)

EXAMPLE 2: TL;DR Addition
BEFORE: # 1. Executive Summary: The Fire Extinguisher of Confetti
        ## Opening
        Most empathetic AIs feel like a refrigerator magnet...

AFTER:  # 1. Executive Summary: The Fire Extinguisher of Confetti
        **TL;DR:** Most empathetic AIs fail by choosing between "cold 
        compliance" and "warm hallucination." IF.emotion proves a third 
        path exists: emotional precision grounded in **307 citations**, 
        validated by external experts, delivered at **6x** empathy speed 
        with **0 errors**. It's not faster. It's more trustworthy.
        ---
        ## Opening
        Most empathetic AIs feel like a refrigerator magnet...

EXAMPLE 3: Numbers Made to Pop
BEFORE: "Built on 307 peer-reviewed citations spanning existential..."
AFTER:  "Built on **307** peer-reviewed citations spanning existential..."

BEFORE: "...consensus evaluation with just 0.071ms overhead."
AFTER:  "...consensus evaluation with just **0.071ms** overhead."

EXAMPLE 4: Visual Breaks Added
BEFORE: ## 7.2 The Cost of Poor Emotional AI
        [paragraph]
        ### User Churn from Cold Safety Disclaimers
        [paragraph]

================================================================================
TOUCHSTONE PHRASES FOR MEMORABILITY
================================================================================

Fire Extinguisher of Confetti
  The central metaphor for current AI safety: looks protective but delivers
  nothing substantive. IF.emotion converts this into a precision instrument.

AI-e (Artificially Intelligent Emotion)
  The class of systems where emotional intelligence is infrastructure, not
  a bolt-on feature. IF.emotion is the proof of concept.

6x Speed
  Not faster—more trustworthy. The rhythm of empathy where thinking is visible
  but impatience doesn't set in. A research finding, not a prescription.

System Forced to Have a Heart
  The architecture demands emotional intelligence. The 20-voice council won't
  approve cold responses. The system is architecturally committed to care.

Production Smell, Not Research-Lab Wishful Thinking
  The validation frame: real humans, real stakes, real credentials, real
  results. This isn't theory—it's proven production-ready.
