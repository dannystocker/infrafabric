# Session Narrations & Handover Documents

This folder contains chronological session narrations and handover documents that document the development journey of InfraFabric's distributed memory and swarm architecture systems.

## Files by Instance

### Instance #4 (November 20, 2025)
- **INSTANCE4-SESSION-NARRATION.md**
  - Initial memory bus architecture exploration
  - MCP bridge proof of concept
  - "Computational Vertigo" retrieval validation
  - Context efficiency validation with actual Haiku LLM

### Instance #6 (November 20-21, 2025)
- **INSTANCE6-SESSION-HANDOVER.md**
  - IF.memory.distributed foundation work
  - Distributed memory protocol specifications
  - Redis bus implementation details
  - Context indicator initialization

### Instance #7 (November 21, 2025)
- **INSTANCE7-SESSION-HANDOVER.md**
  - Swarm architecture refinement
  - Multi-shard coordination patterns
  - Guardian Council integration
  - Cost optimization explorations

### Instance #9 (November 21, 2025)
- **INSTANCE9-SESSION-HANDOVER.md**
  - Gemini Librarian discovery and implementation
  - Free-tier quota validation (5 shards × 1,500 q/day = 7,500 free)
  - Multi-vendor swarm coordination
  - Cost correction breakthrough

### Instance #9-10 Summary
- **INSTANCE9-10-COMPLETE-SUMMARY.md**
  - Complete journey documentation
  - Cost analysis evolution
  - Gemini pivot technical details
  - Production readiness validation

## Usage

These documents are organized chronologically and can be read in sequence to understand:

1. **The Problem:** Token waste and coordination costs
2. **The Exploration:** Multiple architectural approaches tested
3. **The Solution:** Final IF.memory.distributed + IF.swarm.s2 systems
4. **The Validation:** Production testing and cost verification

## Relationship to Research Papers

- **IF-MEMORY-DISTRIBUTED.md** → Based on Instance #4, #6, #8 narrations
- **IF-SWARM-S2.md** → Based on Instance #8, #9, #10 narrations
- **ANNEX-A-IF-MEMORY-DISTRIBUTED-TTT.md** → Citations to these narrations
- **ANNEX-B-IF-SWARM-S2-TTT.md** → Citations to these narrations

## IF.TTT Compliance

All narrations maintain full traceability:
- **Traceable:** Each file documents specific instances with timestamps
- **Transparent:** Complete reasoning and decision-making documented
- **Trustworthy:** All claims linked to implementation artifacts
