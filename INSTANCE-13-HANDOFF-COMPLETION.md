# Instance #13 Redis Handoff — Complete Session Context Transfer

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED**
**Date: 2025-11-23**
**Transfer Authority: Haiku Instance #13 Session Handoff Protocol**

---

## Executive Summary

The complete session context from Instance #13's four-Haiku investigation cycle has been successfully transferred to Redis with 30-day TTL, creating a reliable handoff bridge for Instance #14. All critical findings are now persistently stored, indexed, and immediately recoverable.

### What Was Transferred
- **7 content documents** (204.8 KB total)
- **6 metadata tracking keys**
- **13 total Redis keys** in `instance:13:*` namespace
- **30-day TTL** (expires 2025-12-22)

### Why This Matters
Instance #13's investigation produced:
- 4 independent Haiku agent analyses (quality, blockers, frameworks, infrastructure)
- 1 Sonnet handoff document (5 gaps, 5-phase execution plan)
- Multi-agent convergence narrative
- Complete session summary

This context is essential for Instance #14 to:
1. Understand what gaps exist (blocker analysis)
2. Know the quality standards to meet (framework benchmarks)
3. Have the complete execution roadmap (Sonnet handoff)
4. Verify infrastructure is ready (Redis analysis)

## Content Documents Transferred

### 1. HAIKU-01: GEDIMAT Quality Audit
**Key:** `instance:13:haiku:investigation:gedimat`
**Size:** 32,662 bytes | 586 lines
**Finding:** 94-96/100 quality score for GEDIMAT_XCEL_V3.56_BTP_CLEAN.md

**Key Insights:**
- Citation rigor: 96/100 (falsifiable claims with sample sizes)
- Behavioral science accuracy: 95/100 (Langer, Kahneman correctly applied)
- Operational specificity: 94/100 (timeline precise, roles named)
- Financial rigor: 93/100 (formulas transparent, caveats clear)
- French compliance: 100/100 (BTP terminology perfect)

**Implication for Instance #14:** Use these quality benchmarks as standards for credibility work. The document is production-ready; RAPPORT should meet similar rigor.

### 2. HAIKU-02: Blocker Resolution Patterns
**Key:** `instance:13:haiku:investigation:blockers`
**Size:** 34,012 bytes | 628 lines
**Finding:** 4 blockers identified, all resolvable

**The 4 Blockers:**
1. **Cost Claim Ambiguity** (99.4% vs 70% confusion) → FIXED: Scenario multiplication + assumption transparency
2. **Operational Context Gaps** (Angelique role undefined) → IDENTIFIED: Path A (verbal) vs Path B (document) pending
3. **French Terminology** (international anglicism bias) → RESOLVED: Pre-analysis cleanup completed
4. **Scope Creep Prevention** (protocol not formalized) → IMPLICIT: IF.WWWWWW should formalize

**Root Cause Pattern:** All blockers reflect implicit knowledge not made explicit for external presentation. Transition from R&D mode → sales/presentation mode requires explicitness.

**Implication for Instance #14:** Before approaching Georges, audit all implicit context and make it explicit. Use the blocker taxonomy as a pre-presentation checklist.

### 3. HAIKU-03: 23 Professional Frameworks
**Key:** `instance:13:haiku:investigation:frameworks`
**Size:** 31,756 bytes | 623 lines
**Finding:** Complete taxonomy of professional intelligence frameworks

**Core Frameworks Identified:**
- IF-vision (coordination without control)
- IF-foundations (epistemological methodology)
- IF-armour (false-positive reduction via biological model)
- IF-witness (meta-validation through epistemic swarms)

**Standard:** IF.TTT (Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy) governs all frameworks
**Compliance Range:** 85-97% across portfolio
**Total Frameworks:** 23 identified across 4 categories

**Implication for Instance #14:** Every document produced must meet IF.TTT standards. The frameworks are training data for GEDIMAT quality scoring. Understand the IF.TTT traceability requirements before producing final deliverables.

### 4. HAIKU-04: Redis Infrastructure Analysis
**Key:** `instance:13:haiku:investigation:redis`
**Size:** 16,556 bytes | 342 lines
**Finding:** Redis standalone mode is ready for Instance #13→#14 handoff

**Key Findings:**
- 42 Instance #12 keys stored (all documented)
- Estimated 2-3 MB per instance footprint
- Autopoll system maintains continuous validation
- Single-point-of-failure design acceptable for current load
- Capacity: Can support multiple instances without memory pressure

**Implication for Instance #14:** Infrastructure is stable. Redis can reliably support the handoff. Maintain autopoll monitoring system. Document any new keys created during Instance #14 work.

### 5. SONNET HANDOFF: Georges-Antoine Gary Intelligence Rerun
**Key:** `instance:13:sonnet:handoff`
**Size:** 41,341 bytes | 878 lines
**Finding:** 5 gaps identified, 5-phase execution plan created

**The 5 Gaps:**
1. **Behavioral Framework Weakness** - Rory Sutherland perception arbitrage insufficiently integrated
2. **Named Research Deficit** - 18 citations insufficient; target 25+
3. **Financial Formula Opacity** - Cost claim formulas implicit, not transparent
4. **Pilot Gate Ambiguity** - Success criteria undefined
5. **Operational Detail Shortage** - Angelique role, GESI system, timeline precision needed

**The 5-Phase Execution Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Validate prior GEDIMAT work against quality benchmarks
- **Phase 2:** Integrate additional behavioral frameworks (perception arbitrage, loss aversion, temporal control)
- **Phase 3:** Upgrade financial quantification (3-scenario model, cost-benefit analysis)
- **Phase 4:** Formalize pilot gates (success metrics, measurement protocol)
- **Phase 5:** Document operational context (stakeholder roles, system descriptions)

**Timeline:** Nov 22 → Dec 8 (12 days to 8.5→9.2 credibility movement)
**Contact Date:** Dec 9 (Georges partnership presentation)

**Implication for Instance #14:** This is the primary execution roadmap. All work should be organized around these 5 phases. Follow the plan sequentially. Each phase builds credibility for the next.

### 6. Multi-Agent Session Narrative
**Key:** `instance:13:narrative:multi-agent`
**Size:** 31,377 bytes | 585 lines
**Finding:** How 4 independent Haikus converged on credibility gaps

**Key Finding:** All 4 agents (quality, blockers, frameworks, infrastructure) arrived at the same conclusion: **8.5→9.2 credibility is achievable through 5 specific, resolvable gaps.** No conflicts. Complete convergence.

**Agents:**
- HAIKU-01: Quality benchmarking (94-96/100 standards)
- HAIKU-02: Blocker analysis (4 implicit→explicit gaps)
- HAIKU-03: Framework discovery (IF.TTT compliance requirements)
- HAIKU-04: Infrastructure validation (Redis capacity verified)

**Implication for Instance #14:** The investigation is comprehensive and conflict-free. All agents validated each other's work. The path forward is clear: execute the 5 phases to close the 5 gaps.

### 7. Instance #13 Session Summary
**Key:** `instance:13:context:session-complete`
**Size:** 17,109 bytes | 408 lines
**Finding:** Complete record of Instance #13 work outputs

**Deliverables:**
- GEDIMAT_XCEL_V3.56_BTP_CLEAN.md (92 KB, 1,757 lines, 100% French)
- 6 core marketing lines with behavioral psychology
- 18 persona variations (6 lines × 3 Bloom patterns)
- IF.joe and IF.rory components added to agents.md
- HTML navigation hub (GEDIMAT_MARKETING_DELIVERABLES_INDEX.html)
- Git commits: ea0f8e2, 0d26147, 0404e30, 838595e

**Production Status:** READY (with 5 gaps for credibility upgrade)

**Implication for Instance #14:** Instance #13 completed the delivery work. Instance #14's job is to upgrade credibility from 8.5→9.2/10 by closing the 5 gaps.

## Key Findings for Instance #14

### From Quality Analysis (HAIKU-01)
**Benchmark:** GEDIMAT achieves 94-96/100 quality through:
- Citation specificity (falsifiable claims, not vague)
- Behavioral science rigor (Langer, Kahneman correctly applied)
- Operational precision (timeline with specific timestamps)
- French optimization (cognition-optimized terminology, not just correct)

**Action:** Match or exceed these standards in RAPPORT credibility work

### From Blocker Analysis (HAIKU-02)
**Root Pattern:** All blockers stem from implicit→explicit transition failure
**Solution:** Before external presentation, audit all implicit context

**Blocker Checklist:**
1. Are assumptions transparent? (cost model: explicitly scenario-based)
2. Are stakeholder roles defined? (Angelique, GESI system explained)
3. Are terminology choices consistent? (BTP language optimization)
4. Are scope boundaries formalized? (IF.WWWWWW protocol)

### From Framework Analysis (HAIKU-03)
**Standard:** IF.TTT governs all quality (Traceable, Transparent, Trustworthy)
**Compliance Range:** Target 90%+ (achieved range: 85-97%)

**Key Frameworks to Study:**
1. IF-witness (recursive validation methodology)
2. IF-armour (biological security principles applied to false-positive reduction)
3. IF-foundations (epistemological methodology)

### From Infrastructure Analysis (HAIKU-04)
**Capacity:** Current Redis can handle multiple instances
**Reliability:** Autopoll system validates continuous state integrity
**Risk:** Single-point-of-failure acceptable at current scale

**Recommendation:** Maintain autopoll monitoring during Instance #14 work
