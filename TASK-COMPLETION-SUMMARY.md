## KEY INSIGHTS SUMMARY

### Why Georges-Antoine Gary is Perfect Partner (92/100 readiness)

**Top 3 Reasons:**
1. ✅ AI-forward (already positioned with "AI Augmented" in 2021)
2. ✅ Perfect customer base (50-100 IT/B2B companies spending $100K-$500K/year on APIs)
3. ✅ No competitive conflicts (solo consultant, not agency—can partner freely)

### How to Approach Him (Intelligence-Driven Strategy)

**The Pitch (30 seconds):**
> "Georges, you positioned as 'AI Augmented PR Pro' in 2021. Your clients now need the next layer: AI Orchestrated—governance, cost reduction, transparency. InfraFabric gives them that. And you can generate €100K-€300K per year in new consulting revenue. Can I show you how?"

**What to Lead With:**
1. RAPPORT-POUR-GEORGES-ANTOINE-GARY.md (French report)
2. demo-guardian-council.html (5-minute demo)
3. Test #1B results (proof: 70% cost savings validated)

**When:**
- Week of Dec 9: Send email (French) with report + demo link
- Dec 10-15: Live demo (if interested)
- Dec 17+: Partnership discussion (if demo works)

**Objection Handling:**
- "Sounds too good" → Show Test #1B evidence + 94% citation accuracy
- "Clients won't adopt" → Frame as cost-reduction, not new system + offer 14-day pilot
- "I already work with others" → Position as enhancement (new revenue stream, not competition)
