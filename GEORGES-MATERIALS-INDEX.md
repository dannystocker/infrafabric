## IF YOU GET STUCK

### "What if he says X?"

**Common Objections & Responses:**

| Objection | Where to Find Response |
|-----------|----------------------|
| "Sounds too good to be true" | RAPPORT - Risk & Validation section |
| "My clients won't adopt this" | QUICK-REFERENCE - Objections & Responses |
| "I already work with others" | QUICK-REFERENCE - Objections & Responses |
| "How much time will this take?" | QUICK-REFERENCE - Objections & Responses |
| "What if InfraFabric doesn't work?" | QUICK-REFERENCE - Objections & Responses |
| "Why you vs. a big agency?" | QUICK-REFERENCE - Objections & Responses |

**Quick tip:** All objection responses are in QUICK-REFERENCE-GEORGES-PARTNERSHIP.md

---

### "What if he doesn't respond?"

**Follow-up Strategy:**

1. **Day 1-2:** No response expected (give him time to read)
2. **Day 3:** If no response, send LinkedIn message
3. **Day 5:** If still no response, try phone call (if you have number)
4. **Day 7:** Send final follow-up with highest-impact stat (€280K savings)
5. **Day 14:** If still no interest, add to "follow up in 3 months" list

**Key:** Stay professional, not pushy. He's busy. Give 2-3 weeks before giving up.

---

### "What if demo fails?"

**Failure Recovery:**

1. **He doesn't watch entire demo** → Offer to show again, shorter version
2. **He has technical questions** → Refer to COMPONENT-AUDIT or promise to follow up
3. **He seems uninterested** → Ask "What would make this interesting?" and listen
4. **He's skeptical** → Offer to show with one of his actual clients (real test)
5. **Wrong timing** → Say "Can I check back in 3 months?" and stay in touch

**Key:** The demo is proof of concept. If he's not ready, that's OK. Stay on his radar.
