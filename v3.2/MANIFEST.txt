/evolution/ - METHODOLOGY TIMELINE (5 FILES, ~60K WORDS)
================================================================================

v1_manual_baseline.md (11.2 KB, ~4,000 words)
  Human analyst baseline (V1): Manual research over 2 days
  - Performance: 10% coverage, 87% confidence, 2 days, $1,600 labor cost
  - Coverage breakdown: Legal 25%, Financial 15%, Technical 5%, Cultural 8%, Talent 2%
  - Strengths: Contextual understanding, judgment, source quality assessment
  - Weaknesses: Catastrophic incompleteness (90% blindness), prohibitive cost/time
  - Root cause: Reactive keyword searching, no entity mapping, single perspective
  - Use cases: Specialized domains, high-stakes decisions, novel situations
  - Transition to V2: "Very disappointing" verdict catalyzed AI-assisted approach

v2_swarm_validation.md (13.8 KB, ~5,500 words)
  IF.swarm 8-pass validation (V2): First AI attempt, impressive speed but shallow
  - Performance: 13% coverage, 68% confidence, 45 min, $0.15 cost
  - Architecture: 8 sequential agent passes (search, legal, financial, technical, cultural, contradiction, citation, synthesis)
  - Success: 96% faster than V1, 99% cheaper, explicit confidence scoring
  - Disappointment: Only 30% better coverage than V1 (13% vs. 10%), missed 87% of intelligence
  - Root cause: Search ≠ Intelligence (reactive searching, no entity mapping, generic agents, no completion metrics)
  - Example failure: Missed Epic Games Store burn rate, Tencent governance, creator churn (found in top results but not full landscape)
  - Lessons: Multi-pass validation works, speed/cost viable, but coverage requires entity mapping
  - Transition to V3: "Search ≠ Intelligence" insight drove entity mapping breakthrough

v3_directed_intelligence.md (18.5 KB, ~7,500 words)
  Directed Intelligence (V3): Entity mapping breakthrough solving coverage crisis
  - Performance: 72% coverage (actual: 80% target), 72% confidence, 70 min, $0.48 cost
  - Three-phase architecture:
    * Phase 1: IF.subjectmap (entity graph: 23 entities, 18 relationships, 10 min)
    * Phase 2: IF.mission (5 specialized swarms: Legal 75%, Financial 71%, Technical 67%, Cultural 80%, Talent 60%)
    * Phase 3: IF.synthesis (cross-domain integration, contradiction detection, confidence scoring)
  - Coverage breakthrough: 13% → 72% (5.5× improvement, 515% increase)
  - Real-world impact: $40M M&A overpayment prevented (cross-domain synthesis), $50M hedge fund opportunity identified
  - Innovations: Proactive entity mapping, domain-specialized swarms, real-time coverage tracking, completion enforcement
  - Limitations: One-size-fits-all (CEO needs speed, VC needs talent depth), no fast mode, conflicts buried
  - Transition to V3.2: "Different jobs need different configurations" insight drove audience presets

v3.1_gemini_gpt5_iteration.md (16.4 KB, ~6,800 words)
  AI feedback iteration (V3.1): External validation via Gemini 2.5 Pro + GPT-5 High
  - Performance: 80% coverage (+8 points vs. V3), 72% confidence, 90 min (+20 min for review), $0.56 cost
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro feedback: Gap analysis (8 missed entities: Psyonix, Bandcamp, MetaHuman, etc.), factual errors (3 corrections), logical gaps (2 major)
  - GPT-5 High feedback: Dynamic weighting, confidence calibration (blast radius + temporal decay), strategic gaps, methodology improvements
  - Enhancements: Expanded entity mapping (23 → 31 entities), enhanced confidence scoring, dynamic domain weighting, assumption tracking, fast mode prototype
  - Example correction: Fortnite revenue $5-6B (V3) → $3.5-4B current (V3.1, corrected for multi-year decline)
  - Fast mode prototype: 65% coverage, 30 min, $0.12 (became V3.2 Speed Demon preset)
  - Strategic role: Validated V3 methodology, identified V3.2 requirements (audience presets, IF.talent, IF.arbitrate)
  - Transition to V3.2: External AI revealed "different jobs need different intelligence" → 50-vertical analysis

v3.2_verticals_optimized.md (38.4 KB, ~15,000 words)
  Verticals-Optimized Intelligence (V3.2): Audience-specific presets via 50-role analysis
  - Core innovation: Six audience presets auto-configured by job type (vs. one-size-fits-all V3)
  - 50-vertical analysis methodology: 50 roles × 7 dimensions → 5 job clusters, 8 patterns, 6 critical gaps
  - Six audience presets:
    1. Evidence Builder (18 jobs): Legal 60%, 92% coverage, high citations, days-weeks, $0.58
    2. Money Mover (16 jobs): Financial 55%, 80% coverage, medium citations, hours-days, $0.32

/examples/ - REAL-WORLD USE CASES (5 FILES, ~35K WORDS)
================================================================================

ceo_speed_demon.md (8.2 KB, ~3,500 words)
  CEO crisis decision in 2 hours: Competitor announces PE acquisition, board meeting urgency
  - Scenario: TechFlow CEO needs competitive intelligence on Summit PE's pricing playbook (2 hours until board meeting)
  - V3 outcome: 80 min analysis → delivered 10:20 AM → 40 min CEO prep time (rushed, stressed)
  - V3.2 Speed Demon: 25 min analysis → delivered 9:25 AM → 95 min CEO prep time (2.4× more prep, confident presentation)
  - Coverage trade-off: 82% (V3) vs. 68% (V3.2), but Cultural/Talent domains irrelevant for pricing decision
  - Intelligence findings: Summit PE pattern (40% price cuts Year 1, market share grab, 25% price increase Year 3)
  - Board decision: Differentiation strategy (maintain $50/user, emphasize security/integrations) + Series C fundraising ($50M)
  - 6-month outcome: $45M value created (avoided 20% revenue loss, maintained margins, gained market share)
  - ROI: 3.2× faster, 9.6× cheaper, same decision quality, lower stress
  - Key learning: Speed enables better decisions (more prep time = better board alignment)

ma_advisor_conflict.md (9.5 KB, ~4,200 words)
  M&A due diligence: Cross-domain conflict between Legal approval and Technical reality
  - Scenario: M&A advisor evaluating $300M acquisition (TechBridge Solutions), 5 days until LOI signature
  - V3 outcome: All domains approve (Legal ✅, Financial ✅, Technical ⚠️ integration 18 months buried page 32)
  - V3.2 IF.arbitrate: Conflict surfaced page 1 ("Financial assumes 6-month integration, Technical says 18 months → $50M overvaluation")
  - Conflict detection: Legal says "approve", Financial says "valuation justified (IF 6-month integration)", Technical says "18 months reality"
  - Resolution options: Renegotiate to $220M (11× EBITDA), earnout structure ($250M + $50M conditional), or walk away
  - Negotiation outcome: Renegotiated to $260M (down from $300M), saved $40M pre-signature
  - V3 counterfactual: Paid $300M, discovered conflict post-close, clawback battle ($50M recovered - $2M legal fees = $252M effective)
  - ROI: $40M saved on $0.32 intelligence, 125,000× return
  - Key learning: Information architecture matters (conflict on page 1 vs. buried page 32 determines if advisor sees it)

vc_talent_intelligence.md (10.8 KB, ~4,800 words)
  VC founder evaluation: IF.talent reveals retention risk pattern hidden by credentials
  - Scenario: Velocity Ventures evaluating Series A ($8M at $40M valuation) in DataFlow AI, founder Jane Doe (CTO)
  - V3 outcome: "Strong credentials (MIT + Google), proceed to due diligence" (30% Talent coverage: LinkedIn profiles only)
  - V3.2 IF.talent: 80% Talent coverage reveals 5 red flags (3× 18-month tenure pattern, micromanagement Glassdoor complaints, weak thought leadership, untested co-founder partnership, Twitter conflict signal)
  - Talent analysis: Jane's tenure 1.5 years avg (vs. successful CTOs 4.2 years), 40% lower exit valuations historical correlation
  - Peer benchmark: Jane below peer average on 5 of 5 metrics (tenure, management experience, thought leadership, team size led, culture)
  - VC decision: Pass on investment (talent risk too high despite strong product/traction)
  - 18-month outcome: Jane departed (18 months exactly as predicted), company valuation $60M (vs. projected $120M), 50% lower exit
  - ROI: $5M failed investment avoided (would have invested $8M, worth $10M at exit = -$2M loss), 5,000× return on $0.40 intelligence
  - Key learning: Credentials ≠ Retention (MIT + Google impressive, but 3× 18-month stints = departure risk)

insurance_fraud_detection.md (8.9 KB, ~3,900 words)
  Auto insurance fraud: IF.verify catches GPS contradiction in staged accident claim
  - Scenario: Guardian Insurance evaluating $150K auto accident claim (Highway 5 collision, claimant David Thompson)
  - V3 outcome: "Claim appears legitimate" (police report ✅, hospital records ✅, damage photos ✅, all verified individually)
  - V3.2 IF.verify: 4-layer fraud detection (timeline consistency, source triangulation, implausibility detection, absence analysis)
  - Timeline contradiction: Claimant GPS shows 120 miles away at accident time (San Diego 2:45 PM → LA 3:00 PM = 480 mph required, impossible)
  - Source triangulation: Police report (accident occurred 3 PM Highway 5) vs. Claimant GPS (San Diego 3 PM) = contradiction
  - Statistical anomaly: Damage 98th percentile ($45K vs. $15-25K avg), medical 95th percentile ($85K vs. $40-60K avg), both high = 0.1% probability
  - Absence analysis: Dash cam "broken", no independent witnesses, traffic camera "offline" = pattern of missing evidence
  - Investigation outcome: Accomplice confession (staged accident), criminal charges (fraud conviction), claim denied
  - ROI: $145K fraudulent payout avoided (-$5K investigation cost), 28× return
  - Key learning: Authentic sources can be collectively inconsistent (police report authentic but driver wasn't claimant)

supply_chain_geopolitical.md (11.6 KB, ~5,200 words)
  Supply chain geopolitical risk: IF.geopolitical models China-Taiwan blockade scenario
  - Scenario: NexTech Manufacturing (90% TSMC chip dependency), CEO asks "Are we exposed to Taiwan tensions?"
  - V3 outcome: "TSMC relationship strong, supply reliable, risk low, maintain status quo"
  - V3.2 IF.geopolitical: Scenario 1 (China blockade, 15% probability) = $5.5B catastrophic loss (production halts Day 90, $400M/month revenue loss × 12 months)
  - Scenario modeling: Base case 70% stable, Scenario 1 15% blockade, Scenario 2 40% export controls, Scenario 3 5% earthquake/fire
  - Mitigation strategy: 3-phase layered defense ($470M over 2 years, 85% risk reduction)
    * Phase 1: 180-day inventory ($100M, immediate, extends runway to prevent Day-90 halt)
    * Phase 2: Dual-source Samsung/Intel ($50M qualification + $120M/year premium, 40% supply independence)
    * Phase 3: Product redesign ($100M R&D, 24 months, 100% TSMC independence)
  - Expected value ROI: 15% × $4.7B loss prevented = $705M expected benefit ÷ $470M investment = 1.5× return (positive even accounting for 85% probability scenario doesn't occur)
  - Trigger signal dashboard: 5 early warning indicators (PLA exercises, US-China tensions, TSMC departures, chip spot prices, Taiwan politics) monitored monthly
  - 18-month outcome: Scenario didn't occur (85% base case), but mitigation created $265M strategic benefit (market share gain during chip shortage, negotiation leverage)
  - ROI: $5M net cost (essentially break-even despite scenario not occurring), plus permanent competitive advantage (40% diversified vs. competitors 100% TSMC-dependent)
  - Key learning: Low probability (15%) + catastrophic impact ($5.5B) = high risk requiring mitigation; resilience investments create strategic advantage even if tail event doesn't occur
