# Dossier Difference Report

This report compares the major InfraFabric dossier variants that live outside the reorganized tree and in the repo root. Entries describe scope, size, apparent generation window, and structural uniqueness.

## INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11.md (repo root, ~73 KB, last modified 2025-11-19 11:26)
- **Scope & date:** A full 22-day chronicle of InfraFabric (Oct 26 – Nov 7) that stitches narrative, engineering telemetry, and guardianship doctrine into one canonical doc.
- **Unique structure:** Ten story sections (Sections 0–10) walk through the ramp-up, philosophy breakthrough, validation stack, and token economics; the document then layers 12 annexes (ANNEX A–P) covering timeline, component metrics, Wu Lun spec, guardian council roster, reproducibility package, cost economics, and GPT-5 reflexion notes.
- **Distinguishing material:** ANNEX G (“Reproducibility Package”) and ANNEX K (“Complete Source Index”) consolidate evidence, while Sections 7–9 explicitly name IF.search, IF.armour, and IF.witness. This version subsumes earlier dossiers by referencing day-by-day metrics, component overviews, and token economics scaffolding.

## INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v8-CORRECTED.md (external, ~26 KB, modified 2025-11-07 18:19)
- **Scope & date:** Twelve-day focused rewrite emphasising the crisis-to-consensus arc; uses October/November 2025 timestamps and rewrites the earlier “12-Day Transformation” story with corrective annotations.
- **Unique structure:** Sections 0–6 narrate the journey from the laptop-homelab-test-machine “three cliffs” through Days 1–12, concluding with Annexes A–H that document timelines, philosophy databases (Eastern & Western) and the Gap Analysis / Comparative Landscape. Annex B enumerates philosophers, Annex C tracks component metrics’ evolution, Annex G ties in reproducibility, and Annex H begins to sketch future months.
- **Distinguishing material:** Contains explicit “Corrected for the 12-Day Timeline” language (Annex D/E), emphasises “Week 1–2 / Month 2–3 / Month 6–12” rollout, and calls out the Yologuard crisis on Day 10, unlike v11, which layers more component-level metrics and annex expansions.

## InfraFabric v7.01 Complete Documentation Suite (external, ~99 KB, modified 2025-11-05 03:26)
- **Scope & date:** A philosophy-first master dossier rooted in guardian archetypes, cyclic emotional states, and a twelve-section strategic/technical report. This is the oldest variant here, predating the “22-day” timeline and foregrounding constitutional framing.
- **Unique structure:** The first half (Part I) is a philosophical compendium with the four cycles, guardian definitions (Technical, Civic, Ethical, Cultural, Contrarian), specialist empathy guardians, and the “Civilizational Wisdom” survey. Part II dives into IF.yologuard production deployment, covering architecture, MCP tooling, benchmark metrics, and monitoring. Part III catalogs IF components in detail, while Part IV is a navigation index and Part V collects council debate annexes.
- **Distinguishing material:** Introduces the “Emotionally Intelligent Token Economics” metaphor, the “Palimpsest Principle,” and adds a comprehensive component catalog (IF.core, IF.router, IF.trace, IF.garp, IF.optimise, etc.) far earlier than later dossiers. It also spells out multi-model consensus tables and operational test scenarios (Sections 2.3–2.5).

## INFRAFABRIC Complete Package – November 15, 2025 (external, ~5.9 KB, mod 2025-11-15 21:54)
- **Scope & date:** A lightweight index for the November 15 bundle, summarizing which papers, APIs, and directories are current at that snapshot.
- **Unique structure:** Lists four paper slots, four API work files, and a V3.2 “Complete Bundle” directory tree (evolution/, examples/, verticals/). Includes an “OpenAI Application Package” pointer, a Paper Status Summary, key metrics, a “What to Read First” primer, and a file-location map. This is not a narrative dossier but an onboarding manifest for the other documents.
- **Distinguishing material:** Serves as the anchor for ingestion/evidence work; it enumerates packages and directories that should be synchronized when external dossiers are imported into the repo’s `docs/` or `infra/` directories.
