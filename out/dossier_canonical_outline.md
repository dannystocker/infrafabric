# Canonical InfraFabric Outline
This outline organizes the sprawling dossiers into six editorial pillars. Each heading points to the canonical source files and sections where that content currently lives.

## 1. Vision & Narrative
- `papers/IF-vision.md`: articulates the dreams, civic tone, and cycle transitions referenced in later sections.
- `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11.md`: Section 0 (Day 1 proof of concept), Section 1 (Day 1 timeline), Section 2 (Days 2–6 bridge building), and Section 7 (Validation Stack) form the narrative spine.
- `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v8-CORRECTED.md`: Section 0–5 recounts the corrected 12-day journey, so readers can compare the earlier arc with the 22-day rewrite.

## 2. Foundations & Guardian Doctrine
- `IF-foundations.md`: canonical definition of the five cycles and the veto/dissent rules, referenced in both dossier v7.01 (Part I) and v11 (Sections 6–9).
- `IF-armour.md`: the Tech/Ethic/Civic/Cult/Contra guardian matrix feeds into `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v7.01` Part I (guardian archetypes, empathy guardians) and v11 Section 8 (Component Overview).
- `philosophy/IF.philosophy-database.*`: stores raw data for the “Philosophical Foundation” content in v7.01 and the glimpses in v8’s Annex B.

## 3. Armour, Security & Evaluation Production
- `IF-armour.md` & `papers/IF-armour*`: detail the Yologuard immune idea and Confucian relationships; these map to v11 Section 8 (Component Overview) plus Annexes N–P (optimise framework, precursor conversation, GPT-5 reflexion cycle).
- `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v7.01.md` Sections 2.1–2.5: describe the IF.yologuard production deployment, MCP tooling, and benchmark metrics (secret redaction, confusion matrix).
- `docs/evidence/INFRAFABRIC_EVAL_*` and `INFRAFABRIC_COMPLETE_PACKAGE_Nov15.md`: collect the audit YAMLs, evaluation prompts, and reproducibility references that underlie the armour validation.

## 4. Witness & Observability
- `papers/IF-witness.md`: the canonical witness spec, mirrored in v11 Sections 4–5 (Crisis & Validation) and Annex C (Component Metrics) and the `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v7.01` Section 3.5 (Cross-Domain Validation).
- `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11` Annex C and Section 5.3: highlight the validation stack, the Wu Lun breakthrough, and the `IF.search` methodology described under “Validation Stack” headings.

## 5. Evaluations, Evidence & Documentation Bundles
- `docs/evidence/` (existing YAML/MD files): host most evaluation reports, consensus summaries, and inventory CSVs; these feed into the evidence pillars of the dossiers.
- `INFRAFABRIC_COMPLETE_PACKAGE_Nov15.md`: lists the bundled papers (4 total), API work, V3.2 directories, and metrics, providing quick links to the documents above.
- `out/moves_external_candidates.csv`: points at external dossiers that should join this pillar (multiple COMPLETE-DOSSIER variants, source indexes, and the `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-SOURCE-INDEX`).

## 6. Roadmap, Metadata & Governance
- `docs/meta/INFRA_REORG_PLAN.md` & `docs/meta/IF_COMPONENT_STATUS.md`: describe the repo-level roadmap and the public status of each IF.* component; these will move under `infra/meta/` to sit beside the reconstructed tree.
- `INFRAFABRIC-COMPLETE-DOSSIER-v11` Section 10 (Token Economics) and Annexes D–K: provide cost, timeline, and governance notes that should anchor the roadmap narratives.
- `INFRA_REORG_PLAN.md`: existing meta doc for reorganizing; plan references the same guardians, evaluation, and orchestration groupings that inform this outline.
